## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the February 1981 shooting death of 24-year-old John T. McCarthy, a city of Dallas police officer. Nethery was raping a 22-year-old woman in his car parked near White Rock Lake when McCarthy and his partner Phillip Brown pulled up in their squad car. Not knowing the woman was being raped, the officers told the two to leave the area. As the officers started to walk away, Nethery stepped from the car, said, "Officers, I'm sorry," and fired three shots at McCarthy, striking him once in the back of the head. Brown fired three shots at Nethery before chasing him into the lake, where Nethery swam a few yards before surrending when Brown fired a fourth shot at him. Nethery was not hit by any of the shots. McCarthy was rushed to a Dallas hospital, where he died two days later.

## Last statement
Well, I just wanted to ask people to pray for two families: my family and the family of Officer McCarthy. I appreciate the prayers. Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
