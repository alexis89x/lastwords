## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the murder of Paula Stiner, 27, during the burglary of her Friendswood home. Stiner, who had lived in the home at 448 E. Castleharbor only 3 months, was beaten with a hammer and repeatedly stabbed after being confronted by Shields upon her return from work. Shields had entered the home earlier in the day but waited inside for several hours so he could also steal the owner's car upon her return from work. Shields attacked Stiner first with a hammer and then with a knife, inflicting some cut and stab wounds. Before fleeing in Stiner's car, Shields stole credit cards from her purse and used one at Willowbrook Mall only 1 hour and a half after the killing. He was arrested 3 days later while driving the victim's car in The Woodlands.
