## Last statement
I want to tell you folks there, of a' I have a love in my heart for you. I hope you don't look for satisfaction or comfort or peace in my execution. Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior and I want him to be yours. I'm sorry for the pain and heartache I've caused your family. Too many years I've caused all my family problems and heartache. I'm sorry. I wanted to let you know that the Lord Jesus is my life and I just want to go. I'm gonna fall asleep and I'll be in his presence shortly. I got reason to rejoice and I pray to see all of you there someday.
