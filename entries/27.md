## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the December 1982 robbery-slaying of 44-year-old Christine Baker of Kountz. Baker was shot in the head with a .22 caliber rifle while she sat knitting and watching television in the living room of her home, four miles south of Kountze. The fatal shot was fired through a window from outside the residence. Streetman and three other men had planned to rob Baker and her husband, Nyle, of $180,000 they believed the couple had in the home. Court records indicate the couple kept about $50,000 in cash and cashier's checks in the residence, but only Mrs. Baker's purse, and the $1 in change inside, was taken. Streetman, who began a life of crime upon becoming involved with drugs at age 8, reportedly told an accomplice on the way to the Baker home that he was "going to do something I've alway wanted to do - kill another human being."
