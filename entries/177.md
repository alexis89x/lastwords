## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the stabbing death of 23-year-old Marilyn Peters at her rural Cleveland, Texas home. Peters was raped, stabbed more than 19 times with a kitchen knife, and then raped a second time after her death. Her nude body was found on the living room floor of her home in the Old Snake River Lake subdivision. Robbery was not a motive in the murder since Peters was still wearing her jewelry and nearly $500 was found on her bedroom dresser. Authorities also found nearly two pounds of marijuana inside the residence. Little claimed he had become acquainted with the victim through her sale of marijuana to him. Blood-stained blue jeans and towels were found at Little's residence on Buckley Drive. He was arrested there.
