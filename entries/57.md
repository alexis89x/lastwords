## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the February 1980 shooting death of 22-year-old Donna Kate Thomas inside her south Houston apartment. Stewart and Kelvin Kelly, who lived in the same apartment complex as the victim at 11710 Algonquin, were walking through the complex when they noticed Thomas door open. Stewart asked Kelly for his .25-caliber pistol because he wanted to go in and see what he could steal. Kelly heard Thomas scream, "0h, my God" and rushed in to see what was happening. Kelly said Stewart and Thomas were in a bedroom and that Stewart told her to undress. After she complied, Stewart placed her in a closet,where she was joined by her 4-year-old daughter when she entered the apartment. Stewart eventually@@removed the two from the closet and demanded sex from Thomas. When she refused and started crying, he became upset, put his pistol to her head, covered it with a pillow, and shot her twice. Stewart reportedly left the apartment with $50.
