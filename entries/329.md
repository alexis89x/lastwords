## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the November 1993 murder of 23-year-old Nicholus West in Tvler. Following his arrest, Aldrich told police that he and two accomplices abducted West from a Tyler park and robbed him because they believed him to be a homosexual. West's half-naked, bullet-riddled body was found in a clay pit about 10 miles outside of Tyler. Aldrich and his co-defendants were said to have been involved in earlier drive-by shootings, robberies, burglaries, car-jackings, arson and gay bashing.
