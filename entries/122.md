## Last statement
I would like to apologize for all of the hurt, pain and disappointment I caused to my family and all my friends. I hope all the veterans and teenagers out there who have a drug problem will get help. I hope the lord will forgive me of all of my sins. I thank Jack and Kathy for being with me. I hope that those who support the Death Row inmates will continue to work and maybe we can get this resolved and do away with the Death Penalty. I hope this is a lot better place where I am going.
