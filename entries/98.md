## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the June 1986 abduction and shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Sandra Sorrell, in San Antonio. Sorrell was walking to nursing school near downtown San Antonio when Sattiewhite grabbed her in a headlock, dragged her several hundred feet across a parking lot and then shot her twice in the head with a .22-caliber pistol. Sattiewhite then turned the gun on himself and attempted to commit suicide. The gun misfired. For more than a month before the murder, Sorrell had been calling police and the Bexar County District Attorney's Office in an effort to keep Sattiewhite away from her.
