**Summary of Incident**  
Clark was sentenced to die for the April 4, 1981 murder of bartender Joseph Edward McClain. At approximately 3 a.m. Clark broke into McClain's apartment in the 3200 block of Clarewood and awoke the victim, his girlfriend, Paulette Spies, and her son. He burglarized the apartment, and was attempting to rape Spies when a three-way fight over Clark's pistol ensued. During the struggle, Spies was shot in arm and McClain was fatally shot in the chest. Court records show that approximately 2 weeks after this incident, Clark burglarized another apartment during which he robbed the male victim and raped the female victim. He also raped and sodemized  
the female victim's ten year old daughter. Several months later Clark again burglarized an apartment, raped and sodomized both the complainant and her eleven year old daughter. Clark admitted terrorizing more than 100 families during late night burglaries and often sexually assaulting the women.

**Last statement**  
I told the daughter not to come. Discontinue; be quiet, please. Specifically, I want to say that the bad evil man I was when I came to death row 13 years ago is no more ' by the power of God; Jesus Christ; God Almighty; Holy Spirit, he has transformed me as a new creature of Christ. I know that I am a Christ child and that my Lord will welcome me into His arms.  
Jesus Christ is the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings. I love all of you, those I can and can't see. With the love of Christ, my love for you is secure and I love you purely and wholeheartedly in the name of the Almighty God.
