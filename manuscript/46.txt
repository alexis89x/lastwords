**Summary of Incident**
Ellis was convicted of capital murder in the Feb. 27, 1983 death of 74-year-old Bertie Elizabeth Eakens of Houston. Eakens' body was found March 1, 1983 in the bathtub of her apartment in the 2200 block of 18th St. Her hands were handcuffed and a pillow case had -been tied around her neck so she suffocated. Her jewelry, checks, furs, and car were taken from the residence. Ellis had formerly worked as a maintenance man at Eakens' apartment complex and reportedly used a pass key to gain entrance to her apartment. The killing of Eakens and two other Houston women found in bathtubs came to be called the "bathtub slayings."

I just want everyone to know that the prosecutor and Bill Scott are sorry sons of bitches. To his family he added that he loved them all.
