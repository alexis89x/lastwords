Maso and Fred Norris, 16, were working the midnight shift when Larry Smith and Gloster Ray Smith entered the store at 3:15 a.m. and demanded the safe be opened. Mason did not have the two keys needed to open the safe. Smith then took the cash drawer and shot Mason once in the back of the head as he lay face down on the floor. Smith's accomplice, Gloster Ray Smith, received a life sentence for aggravated robbery.

Tell my mother I love her and continue on without me. God bless her. Tell the guys on death row to continue their struggle to get off death row. That's about it.
