## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the robbery and shooting death of 42-year-old Herbert P. Primm, Jr. of Arlington. Primm, an optometrist, was shot to death in the driveway of his home at 6415 High Country Trail after opening the trunk of his car to show three TEC-9 assault pistols to Nathan Clark, an accomplice in the murder. Primm held a Federal Firearms License and sold guns out of his home. When Primm opened his trunk to show the guns, Clark and three accomplices, including Ransom, pulled weapons and stole Primm's guns. After Primm told the robbers to "just take them," Ransom bent him over the hood of the car and shot him once in the head with a .44 Magnum. He was arrested three days later in connection with a separate murder case in Fort Worth.

## Last statement
I just want to address Katrina and Rebecca. You have been beautiful to me. Without you in my life, I would not have been able to make it like this. Probably, I would have put up a good fight; you have calmed me. I love you. I respect you. Big brother, you put up the best fight you could and I love you. That is it.
