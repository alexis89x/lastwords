**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the March 1989 robbery and murder of 68-year-old Loretta Stephens. In a statement to police, Fuller said he decided to burglarize Stephens' residence in Lubbock after seeing her sleeping in a recliner in the living room. After finding more than $500 in cash in the house, Fuller said he stood over Stephens for about 10 minutes and then started beating and choking her. He finally suffocated the woman with a pillow when he realized she had survived the initial beating. After tying her hands and feet with telephone cord and sexually assaulting the woman, Fuller placed the victim's body into the trunk of her car, and later, accompanied by a friend, drove to a spot 8 miles north of Lamesa off Highway 87 and dumped it in a stand of high weeds. Fuller and his friend then drove hack to Lubbock where they abandoned the stolen vehicle in a parking lot across from the bus station.
