**Date of execution**: July 11  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the December 1986 shooting deaths of 28-year old Richard Allan Wood and 4-year-old Larry Wayne McMillan, Jr. in Tyler. The two victims, along with Sandra Darlene Williams, the 20-year-old mother of Larry McMillan, returned to their residence in the Southpoint Village Mobile Home Park to find Wilkens inside their trailer armed with a .22-caliber rifle. Wilkens, Williams former boyfriend, shot Wood as he entered the trailer and then shot the boy as he sat on a couch. Wilkens chased Williams from the trailer and shot her in the hip as she ran for help. She made it to the home of a neighbor who called police. Williams, two months pregnant at the time of the shootings, survived her wound and identified Wilkens as the assailant. He was arrested shortly after the shootings at the home of an acquaintance in Troup.
