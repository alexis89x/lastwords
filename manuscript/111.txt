**Summary of Incident**  
Twice convicted of capital murder in the July 1982 mistaken identity killings of three teenagers in a botched murder-for-hire scheme. Accomplice Muneer Mohammad Deeb reportedly hired Spence and two other co-defendants to kill his girlfriend, Gayle Kelley, for a share of the benefits to be paid on a life insurance policy he had taken out on her. However, Spence and his accomplices apparently mistook 17-vear-old Jill Montgomery of Waxahachie for Kelley, who friends said closely resembled Montgomery. Montgomery and friends Ravlene Rice, 17, and Kenneth Franks, 18, were stabbed to death at a Waco lakeside park. Both women were sexually assaulted before being killed. Spence was convicted of capital murder and given the death penalty for the slaying of Montgomery and Franks.

**Last statement**  
Yes, I do. First of all, I want you to understand I speak the truth when I say I didn't kill your kids. Honestly I have not killed anyone. I wish you could get the rage from your hearts and you could see the truth and get rid of the hatred.  
I love you all ' (names of children) ' Corey, Steve (garbled) ' This is very important. I love ya'll and I miss ya'll. O.K., now I'm finished.
