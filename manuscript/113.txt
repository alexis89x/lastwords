**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the September 1983 capital murder of 23-year-old Jimmy Don Ham, whose body was found in a park on the shore of Lake Lewisville. Ham had been shot once in the chest and once in the head. Prosecutors said Gentry, who escaped from a Georgia prison in 1982, killed Ham in a scheme to assume Ham's identity because Gentry was wanted. He was arrested in Austin, Minnesota on September 15, 1983, two days after Ham's body was found.
