**Summary of Incident**  
Lamb admitted he shot Virginia businessman, Jerry Harrison Chafin, 30, to steal his wallet, shaving kit and car. Chafin was found dead by a cleaning woman the morning of November 6, 1982 two days after he had left Virginia for a new job in San Antonio. Lamb was arrested five-days later near Perry, Florida, in Chafin's car. Lamb was released November 5, 1982 from a state prison in Searcy, Arkansas, hitchhiked to Greenville, and met Chafin later that day in the parking lot of a Greenville motel. Lamb said the two men talked in Chafin's room for 30-minutes, and then he found Chafin's automatic pistol.
