**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the March 1985 shooting death of 20-year-old Victor Cerran, a Mexican National, in New Braunfels. Cerran and four other Mexican Nationals reportedly agreed to pay $150 each for Hernandez and another man to drive them to Denton. They were instead taken to a residence in the Skyridge Acres subdivision in New Braunfels and shot with .22-caliber and .25-caliber weapons. Cerran suffered four wounds and was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital. The other four victims survived multiple gunshot wounds and later identified Hernandez and Jesse Garibay Jr. as the men who shot and robbed them. Hernadez was arrested near Potect on 3-13-85 and Garibay in Longview on 3-19-85.
