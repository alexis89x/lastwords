**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the September 1990 murders of two women inside a Beaumont business. Killed were Katherine Thompson, the 46-year-old owner of Therapeutic Massage at 3420 Fannin, and customer Shelly Cutler, 32. Both women were shot in the head with a .357 Magnum pistol by Dinkins following an argument he had with Thompson concerning bad checks he had written to the business. Thompson, who also suffered a chest wound, died at a hospital shortly after the shooting. Cutler, a registered nurse, died the next morning. Dinkins' name was found in an appointment book at the business. He confessed to the murders after police found blood on his pants and the murder weapon in his truck.

**Last statement**  
Written To the families of Ms. Thompson and Ms. Cutler. I am sorry for what happened and that it was because of me that they are gone. If there were any way I could change things and bring them back I would. But I can't. Because of what I caused to happen many people were affected and I am very sorry that I did. I have made my peace with God and I pray that soon everyone will be able to have closure in their hearts and lives. To my family and friends, I love you and some day we will all be together again.
