**Last statement**
I'd like to say that for the murders of Ray Hazelwood and Frank Collier, I'm sorry for that pain it has caused you. To my friends, I'd like to say that I love you and I'm glad you've been a part of my life. Thank you. I'll miss you. Remember that today I'll be with Jesus in paradise. I'll see you again.
Lord Jesus Christ, son of Almighty God, [have] mercy on me as a sinner, forgive me of my sins. I would like to offer up my death for the conversion of sinners on Death Row. Lord Jesus, into your hands I command my spirit.
