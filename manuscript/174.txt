On May 18, 1997, Foust and one co-defendant robbed and murdered a 43-year-old white male in Fort Worth. The victim's hands and feet were bound with speaker wire and then the victim was strangled to death. The victim's credit cards were stolen and later used by Foust. The victim's BMW was also stolen.
