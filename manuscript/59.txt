**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the February 1983 robbery-slaying of 67-year-old Ethyl Delaney at her Houston home. Delaney, who lived alone at 1834 Ojeman and worked as a notary public and property manager, was beaten to death with a cast-iron frying pan and robbed of her cash, jewelry (3 rings), and car. Sawyers, a neighbor of Delaney's who had been to to her home previously to have her notarize his personal papers, told police he ripped off the woman's pants, slapped her, put her on her bed and hit her four times over the head with the skillet. He said the fourth blow broke the handle of the skillet. Testimony showed Sawyers later showed the stolen car and jewelry to friends and then pawned the jewelry for about $200. The pawn ticket and an accident Sawyers was involved in while driving Delaney's car led to his arrest.
