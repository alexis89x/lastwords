On the day of the murder, Griffith asked McCormick for six long-stem roses and then pulled a pistol and robbed her of $400 and four credit cards belonging to her father. Griffith then ordered McCormick into a reception room where he forced her to perform sex acts. During the assault, Griffith pulled a butcher knife and stabbed McCormick 11 times.
