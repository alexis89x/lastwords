**Summary of Incident**  
On April 3, 1996, in Liberty, Morrow abducted and murdered a 21 year old white female. The victim was home on spring break from college when she left her parents' home at approximately 8:30 p.m. to wash her father's car at a nearby car wash. The young woman had planned to drive the car to Houston the following day for a date. Her body was found floating in the Trinity River the day after her disappearance. She had been beaten and her throat slashed. Hair and blood samples taken from Morrow matched those taken from the car Allison drove. A jury took just 13 minutes to sentence Morrow to death following his capital murder conviction.
