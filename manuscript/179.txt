**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the beating death of 42-year old Cathy Harris of Tyler. Harris was beaten to death with a hammer and her body placed in a closet in an effort to conceal the crime. Before fleeing, Tuttle took the victim's purse and a handgun from the residence off CR 1148. Tuttle had been staving with Harris a week prior to the killing but was told to leave for failing to pay his share of the bills. Tuttle was arrested four days later while visiting at a Beaumont hospital. He had Harris' 357 revolver and two of her credit cards in his possession when arrested.

**Last statement**  
To Kathy's family and friends that were unable to attend today, I am truly sorry. I hope my dropping my appeal has in some way began your healing process. This is all I am going to do to help you out in any way for the nightmare and pain that I have caused you, but I am truly sorry and I wish I could take back what I did, but I can't. I hope this heals you.  
To my family: I love you. When the tears flow, let the smiles grow. Everything is all right.  
To my family: I love you.  
Warden, ATW.
