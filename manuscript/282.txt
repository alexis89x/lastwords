**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the shooting death of Lori A. Baker, 20, during the burglary of her home in College Station. Shamburger, a senior medical student at Texas A&M who knew the victim from school, entered Baker's Home at 1008 Bayou Woods in attempt to steal money. He shot Baker in the head with a 9mm pistol when she awoke to find him in her bedroom. Shamburger then kidnapped Baker's roommate Victoria Kohlar when she returned home by placing her in the trunk of a car after binding her hands with duct tape. Shamburger drove only a few blocks from the house before abandoning Kohlar in the unlocked trunk. Shamburger returned to the home and after probing Baker's head wound with a knife in an effort cto retrieve the bullet, poured gasoline on her body and set it afire. Shamburger later walked into the College Station Police Station and surrendered, emptying the bullets from his pistol onto the floor.

**Last statement**  
A lot of people have always asked if there is a Heaven, and I say there is. There is a Heaven and a Hell. They ask, "Who goes to Heaven?" I believe that it is those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:25: For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Romans 6:23: The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. Romans 5:8: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9: If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ, and that He was raised from the dead, thou shalt be saved. John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him shall have everlasting life. A lot of people forget about: John3:36: If you have the Son, you have life and if you have not the Son, the wrath of God lies on you. In this life, we sin and we make mistakes: 1 John 1:19: If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins. I had a verse that jumped out at me a few days ago. Psalm 99:8 speaks of the holiness of God and He was to the people a God who forgave, but He took vengeance on his deeds. I am not here because of my faith in the Lord Jesus, but I am here for not other reason than my own actions. To the Bakers, I am really sorry for the pain and sorrow I caused you. I really do not know what to say, but I am sorry - forgive me. And to my parents, I am sorry for the pain I have caused you. Forgive me; thank you for your love.
