**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted as the triggerman in the murder-for-hire of 29-year-old Theresa Rodriguez. Rodriguez was shot once in the head with a .357 Magnum revolver in the garage of her home at 1118 Grey Oak as she stepped from her car. Police discovered that the victim's husband, Michael Rodriguez, and brother-in-law, Mark Rodriguez, paid Ruiz $2.000 to kill her, apparently so Michael Rodriguez could collect on life insurance policies totaling $250.000. Before the killing, Michael Rodriguez had also applied for additional life insurance policies of $150.000 each on himself and his wife. Ruiz confessed to the scheme in three statements to police.
