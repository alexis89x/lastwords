**Date of execution**: 1990-04-21  

**Summary of Incident**  
Butler was convicted of capital murder in the shooting death of 67-year-old Nathan Oakley, a Houston cab driver, on June 17, 1986. Butler hailed Oakley's cab at the intersection of Blodgett and Scott at 4 p.m. After riding a short distance, Butler pulled out a pistol and shot Oakley three times in the back of the head. The prosecutor said Oakley's pockets were turned inside out and all his money was missing. Oakley, who drove a Skyjack cab, was believed to have been carrying more than $300. Prosecutors said Butler may have killed Oakley because the cab driver recognized him as the man who killed his good friend, A.C. Johnson, in 1973. Ironically, State District Judge Wallace Moore presided over both the Johnson murder case and the Oakley capital murder case.
