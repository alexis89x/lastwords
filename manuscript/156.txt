**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the May 1988 slaying of 24-vear-old David L. Wilburn. Wilburn was shot in the back of the head after interrupting the kidnapping of two persons from a home at 7927 Nassau Circle. Sam Wright, the 57-year-old owner of the home, told police that Camacho and two unnamed accomplices, forced their way into the home and attempted to kidnap him along with 31-year-old Evellyn Banks and her 3-vear-old son Andre. Wright was able to escape the three intruders after they had shot Wilburn and call for police. Evellyn Banks, who was handcuffed, was taken from the home with her son and driven away in a car. Banks and her child reportedly were later killed by Camacho.
