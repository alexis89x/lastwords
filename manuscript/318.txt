**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in connection with the shotgun slayings of three people, including a 10-year-old girl. Killed were Shakiesha Lloyd, 10, Zenobia Anderson, 87, and Caroline Lloyd, 80. The two elder victims were the aunts of Dempsey Lloyd, the father of Shakiesha, who was also shot but survived. Dempsey Lloyd told police that Lagrone shot him as he opened the door to his home at 2004 Amanda St. Lagrone then went through the house, shooting the other three victims. Records indicate the young girl may have been pregnant by Lagrone.

**Last statement**  
Yes. I just want to say I am not sad today or bitter with anybody. Like I've said from day one, I did not go in there and kill them - but I am no better than those that did. Jesus is Lord.
