**Summary of Incident**  
On 11/29/98, Jasper and two co-defendants were responsible for the death of a 33-year old white male, which took place during a robbery. The victim was a musical engineer who owned a recording studio in San Antonio. Jasper had created his own record label and had his own rap group. Jasper went to the recording studio of the victim. He walked up behind the victim and grabbed him by the hair and slit his throat. The victim was then stabbed to death. Jasper covered the victim with a black sheet in order to "not have to look at him." Jasper then began loading vehicles with the equipment inside the studio, estimated to be worth between $10,000 and $30,000. Jasper and his codefendants made several trips taking the property from the studio, and upon returning to the scene of the crime, he was observed to be suspicious, and eventually apprehended by police.
