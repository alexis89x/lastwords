**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted for capital murder. On August 16, 1979, Bass robbed a lounge at gunpoint and fled. After going 1/2 mile from the robbery, he was seen coincidentally by two Houston city marshalls who had a traffic warrant on Bass. Bass was stopped by the officers who noticed his pockets stuffed with rolled coins and dollar bills. Bass pulled his .380 automatic pistol and shot Officer Baker in the stomach then shot at Baker's partner and missed. He then shot Baker again as Baker lay on the pavement. Bass fled and was arrested four days later in Covington, Kentucky. Officer Baker died.
