**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the slayings of his girlfriend Carolina Prado, 37, and her 14-year-old son, Erik Pardo inside their San Antonio home. Both victims were beaten to death with a baseball bat. Following his arrest in San Marcos two days after the murders, Martinez said grabbed the bat and began to beat his girlfriend when she awoke to find him standing over her in the bedroom. Fearful that Erik might discover his murdered mother, Martinez walked into the living room where he was sleeping and struck him repeatedly in the head with the bat. Martinez did not harm Erik's 10-year-old sister, telling her instead to go to her grandmother's home next door and not return. No motive was offered for the killings.
