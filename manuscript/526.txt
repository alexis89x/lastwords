**Summary of Incident**
Convicted on four counts of capital murder in the Oct. 8, 1983 shooting deaths of four men at an ultralight airplane hangar near Sherman. Killed with a .22-caliber gun were Bob O. Tate, 51, a Denison building contractor; Ronald Mayes, 39, a former Sherman police officer; Philip Good, 29, a Grayson County sheriffs deputy; and Jerry Mac Brown, 52, a Sherman interior designer. The four bodies were found in a hangar on Tate's B&B ranch northeast of Sherman. Parts of an ultralight place missing from the hangar were later found in Bower's garage in Arlington. He was arrested at his residence on Jan. 19, 1984. Authorities said Bower killed Tate in order to steal an ultralight he had advertised to sell for $4.000, and then, in turn, killed each of the other three men when they unexpectedly showed up at the ranch hangar.

**Last statement**
"Much has been written about this case, not all of it has been the truth. But the time is over and now it is time to move on. I want to thank my attorneys for all that they have done. The have afforded me the last quarter of a century. I would like to thank my wife, my daughters, family and friends for unwavering support, and all of the letters and well wishes over the years. Now it is time to pass on. I have fought the good fight, I held the faith. I am not going to say goodbye, I will simply say until we meet again. I love you very, very much. Thank you Warden."
