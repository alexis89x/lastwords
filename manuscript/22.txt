**Summary of Incident**  
Moreno was convicted of capital murder in the Oct. 11, 1983 shooting death of Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Russell Lynn Boyd near Hempstead. Boyd, 25, was one of six people prosecutors said Moreno killed during a 160-mile crime spree that started in College Station with the slayings of his brother-in-law, Juan Garza, and Garza's wife, Esther Garza. Boyd was shot to death after stopping Moreno on Texas 6 north of Hempstead for a traffic violation. Moreno was also charged in the shooting deaths of James Bennatte, 62, Allie Wilkins, 79, and Ann Bcnnatt, 70, in Hempstead. Moreno later kidnapped a family of five and forced them to drive him to Pasadena. He then abducted a Friendswood man, who at gunpoint, drove Moreno south on U.S. 59 toward the Rio Grande Valley. DPS officers stopped the car at a roadblock in Wharton County and arrested Moreno.  
In October 1985, Moreno pleaded guilty to murder in the Garza killings and was given a 45-year prison sentence. Prosecutors said Moreno killed the Garzas because they wouldn't help him find his estranged wife. Moreno was also charged with three counts of murder in Waller County and given 35-year prison sentences.
