**Date of Birth**: December 03  

**Date of Offense**: February 06  

**Date of execution**: March 11  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery and murder of 42-year-old Edwin Earl Holder of Buffalo. Holder was reported missing when he failed to return from a fishing trip on the Trinity River. His body was found inside a sleeping bag in the bed of his pickup which was partially submurged in the Trinity River off Hwy 287 near Cayuga. He had been shot six times in the head while camping overnight near the river. Cook and two co-defendants sank Holder's boat and stole his outboard motor and two lanterns. Cook also took Holder's wallet containing about $25.

**Last statement**  
I would like to say to the victim's family, if this goes on record, that I know they have gotten grief and I know with this execution, it will not be any relief to them. That with my death, it will just remind them of their loved one, Mr. Holder. I would like to say to them, "please forgive me for what happened; it was self defense...and I was never able to get up on the stand to tell them." I know this is wrong. I am going home to the Lord.
