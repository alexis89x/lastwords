**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the August 1986 abduction and slaying of Douglas G. Odle, a 24-year-old Houston restaurant manager. Odle and his wife Jenny, also 24 at the time, were abducted from their apartment at gunpoint and forced to drive to several banks and withdraw money from automatic teller machines. They were then forced to drive to the restaurant Odle managed and return with money. Beavers then forced the couple to drive to a field in Galveston County where Doug Odle was shot through the throat after being forced to kneel before Beavers. Beavers drove away from the scene with Odle's wife, who was later raped, shot in the head and  
left for dead. She survived a destroyed left eye and brain damage to testify against Beavers, who was arrested by the FBI in Virginia following the crime.
