**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in slaying of 22-year-old DeAnn Klaus at the Memorial Park Hotel on Waugh Drive in Houston. Klaus, who lived and worked as a waitress at the hotel, was strangled with a belt and pillowcase and then beaten and stabbed with a wooden club after West broke into her room, stripped her of her clothes, and tied her up. West, who was also staying at the motel, told police he killed the woman because he believed she was indirectly responsible for the death of one of his friends. Other residents and guests of the hotel saw West leaving the woman's room covered with blood.
He was arrested at the scene about 30 minutes after Klaus body was found with the splintered piece of wood still embedded in her back.
