**Last statement**  
I guess the first thing I want to do is thank some very special people, Sara and Sabrina. And for affording me the opportunity that ya'll did. It made a real big difference in my life. I thank you. Thank you again from the deepest part of my heart. I'm sorry. The biggest thing I wanted to say was to you and family and I know I haven't had a chance to talk with ya'll in any form or fashion or way or manner. And I regret what happened and I want you to know that I'm sorry. I just ask and hope that sometime down the line that you can forgive me. I think in a lot of ways that without that it becomes very empty and hollow and the only thing we have is hatred and anger. I guess the only thing I have to say about the Death Penalty is that a lot of times people think of it as one sided, but it's not. It's two sided. There pain on both sides and it's not an issue that people just sit there and voice off and say, well, this is a good thing, or this is a bad thing. But it's something that's, you know, needs to be looked at and desired in each heart. I just hope that all of you can understand that and someday forgive me. I want to thank ya'll for affording me the opportunity to talk and meet with ya'll. It meant so much. Thank you so much for being with me and my family. Thank you. I love you.
