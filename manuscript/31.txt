**Date of execution**: May 24, 1989  

**Summary of Incident**  
McCoy was convicted of capital murder in the rape/strangulation death of 18-year-old Cynthia Johnson in Houston on January 1, 1981. Johnson was abducted by McCoy and co-defendants James Emery Paster and Gary Louis LeBlanc Summary, after her car broke down while returning home from a New Years' Eve party. Evidence showed that McCoy raped the woman and then held her legs while Paster and LeBlanc strangled her with electrical wire. The three men were tied to the October 1980 murder-for-hire of Robert Edward Howard and the November 1980 rape and stabbing of Diane Trevino Oliver. Paster was sentenced to death for the shooting of Howard and life in prison for Johnson's murder. LeBlanc testified for the state and was given a 35-year sentence for murder. McCoy, who was in prison on a five-year sentence for burglary when charged in the Johnson murder, was also charged with accessory to murder and given a concurrent 30-year prison term. Courtroom testimony indicated that Johnson was killed because McCoy and his co-defendants agreed they would each kill someone in front of each other and thus seal their mutual trust in blood.
