**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the hatchet slaying of three women in Lancaster, a Dallas suburb. Killed were Donna Sue Jester, 38; her blind cousin, Dalpha Lorene Jester, 64; and Laura Lee Owens, a 20-year-old drifter from Florida who lived with the Jesters and Long in a house at 1010 Bayport. All were hacked to death with a hatchet by Long after he grew tired of hearing them argue. Long had lived at the house since Sept. 19, 1986. He stole a purse,  
money and a car from the residence after the killings. He was arrested about a month later in Austin. During his trial, Long, who called the triple homicide "a satanic" experience, said he would kill again if not given the death penalty.

**Last statement**  
Ah, just ah sorry ya'll. I think of tried everything I could to get in touch with ya'll to express how sorry I am. I, I never was right after that incident happened. I sent a letter to somebody, you know a letter outlining what I feel about everything. But anyway I just wanted, right after that apologize to you. I'm real sorry for it. I was raised by the California Youth Authority, I can't really pin point where it started, what happened but really believe that's just the bottom line, what happened to me was in California. I was in their reformatory schools and penitentiary, but ah they create monsters in there. That's it, I have nothing else to say. Thanks for coming Jack.
