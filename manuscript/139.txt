**Last statement**  
First and foremost I would like to tell the victims' families that I am sorry because I don't feel like I am guilty. I am sorry for the pain all of them have gone through during holidays and birthdays. They are without their loved ones.  
I have said from the beginning and I will say it again that I am innocent. I did not kill no one. I feel like this is the Lord's will that will be done.  
I love you all. You know it. Don't cry.  
Tell my brothers I love them. You all be strong.
