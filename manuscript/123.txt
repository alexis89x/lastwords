**Last statement**  
Yes sir, I do. Well, here we are. I apologize for your loss and your pain, but I didn't kill those people.  
Hopefully we will all learn something about ourselves and about each other and we will learn enough to stop the cycle of hate and vengeance and come to value what is really going on in this world.  
We can't look back.  
I forgive everyone for this process, which seems to be wrong. We all end up doing experiences which we create.  
That is all I have to say about that.  
(There were some unintelligible sentences.)
