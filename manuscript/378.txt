Convicted in the August 1993 murder-for-hire shooting death of Mario Stubblefield in Houston. Jackson was hired by co-defendant Darryl Scott to kill Stubblefield in exchange for $200 in cash. Scott reportedly wanted Stubblefield killed because the victim was scheduled-to testify against Scott in a separate aggravated assault case.

Following the murder, Jackson was involved in an aggravated robbery during which he shot a high school friend and stole money from him.
