**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery and murder of 28-year-old Joseph F. Hall in Houston. Moody and a co-defendant followed Hall to his home, forced their way inside, and demanded money and drugs. While Hall, who was crippled, begged for his life, Moody shot him at close range with a sawed-off shotgun. Moody and his accomplice then fled with $1,200 in cash from the home. Moody later told his co-defendant that he shot Hall because he kept trying to get up from the ground.
