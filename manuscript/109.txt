**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the April 1986 rape and execution-style slaying of Cindy Rounsaville. a 25-year-old Rice University student. Rounsaville was abducted by Barsfield and two other men as she was walking to her car in the parking lot of her southwest Houston apartment complex. She was forced into her car and driven to her bank, where she was forced to withdraw $70 from an automatic teller machine. Rounsaville was then taken to a remote field in far southwest Houston, where she was sexually assaulted by all three men and finally shot twice in the back of the head by Barefield after she tried to run. After the shooting, the suspects reportedly drove the victim's car to the other side of Houston and robbed another woman at gunpoint. They then drove back to near where Rounsaville was killed and set her car afire.
