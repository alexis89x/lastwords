**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the October 1985 murder of 20-vear-old Gail Lenore Smith near Amarillo. Smith, who worked as a cocktail waitress in Fort Worth and often hitched rides with truckers, was raped and strangled to death with a necktie by Boyle, a driver for Jewett Scott Trucking of Mangum, Oklahoma. Her nude body was found north of Amarillo near the Canadian River bridge on Highway 287. Both her hands and feet had been bound by duct tape. Boyle's fingerprints were lifted from the adhesive side of some duct tape found in a trash can not far from the victim's body. Smith's mother told police that her daughter often hitchhiked and preferred to ride with truckers because she trusted them. She had accepted a ride with Boyle in Fort Worth on October 14. The truck was reportedly traveling to Canon City, Colorado with a load of lumber when the murder occurred.
