Convicted in connection with the failed $1.1 million robbery of a Purolatot Armored Inc. van and the killing of 29-year-old security guard Oliver Flores in Houston on April 21, 1981. Testimony showed that Santana and accomplice James Ronald Meanes wore matching green military-like uniforms for a noon attack on the van in a department store parking lot in the 8500 block of the Gulf Freeway. A second security guard who survived the attack said Flores was shot even though he had not gone for his gun. Santana and Meanes were arrested shortly after the robbery in the 8900 block of Winkler. Police found a getaway car parked nearby and recovered two weapons, two green jumpsuits and the money from the van.
