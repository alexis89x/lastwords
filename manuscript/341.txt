**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the May 1996 kidnapping, robbery and murder of 40-year-old Jerry Velez. Velez was abducted in his car at knifepoint outside his San Antonio apartment complex and forced to drive out of the city on Interstate 10. In Kendall County, Roberts instructed Velez to turn off on a road near the intersection of Hwy. 46 and stop the car. When Roberts demanded Velez's shirt, the victim allegedly lunged at Roberts, who inflicted seven stab wounds to Velez. In fleeing the scene in the victim's car, Roberts ran over Velez's body. Roberts drove to Austin and called 911 from a pay phone, saving he had killed a man. He was arrested by a responding officer.

**Last statement**  
Yes sir, Warden Okay I've been hanging around this popsicle stand way too long. Before I leave, I want to tell you all. When I die, bury me deep, lay two speakers at my feet, put some headphones on my head and rock and roll me when I'm dead. I'll see you in Heaven someday. That's all Warden.
