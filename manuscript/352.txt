**Summary of Incident**  
On August 4, 1997, the subject kidnapped a 9-year-old white female in Ozona, Texas, during the nighttime hours.

During this time, a vehicle pulled up behind him and he left the location. He then took the victim to another location, hit her several times on the head with a tire tool, and left the scene. Authorities were given the location of the body by the subject. The victim was found with her hands tied behind her back, deceased.

**Last statement**  
Tell Beth and them I am sorry, truly sorry for the pain that I caused your family. I truly mean that too. She was a friend of mine and I betrayed her trust. I love you all. Tell momma I love her. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want, He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righeousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Our Father, who are in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen All right Warden, let's give them what they want.
