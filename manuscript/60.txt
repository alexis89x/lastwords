**Summary of Incident**  
Duff-Smith was convicted for his part in the October 15, 1975 strangulation death of his wealthy adoptive mother, Gertrude Duff-Sirith Zabolio, at her River Odes home. Through two accomplices, Duff-Smith hired Allen Wayne Janecka to kill his mother so he could collect his inheritance. Duff-Smith promised to pay Janecka and co-conspirator Paul MacDonald a total of $10,000 for the murder. Court records show that Duff-Smith also wanted his stepfather, Dow Zabolio, killed at the same time, but he had traveled to Austria on business. Mrs. Zabolio's death was originally ruled a suicide based on two suicide notes found in her bedroom. A "practice" parity hose tied in in a loop was also found in her dresser drawer. Duff-Smith was not arrested in the case until 1979 when he was suspected of masterminding the murders of his sister and brother-in-law, Diana and John Wanstrath, and their 14-month-old son, Kevin, to gain control of their estate. The probe into Gertrude Zabolio's death was then reopened and police learned Duff-Smith had told a friend about how he arranged to have his mother killed. Dow Zabolio testified that she and her son often argued over her refusal to finance his lavish lifestyle.

**Last statement**  
I am the sinner of all sinners. I was responsible for the '75 and '79 cases. My trial was not just; it was not fair; they lied against me. I love all of those on Death Row, and I will always hold them in my hands. Those who stood by me, I will always love you. Jim and Judy Peterson and Chaplain Lopez, I thank you for staying by my side.
