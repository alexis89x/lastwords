**Summary of Incident**  
Montoya was convicted of capital murder in the shooting death of Dallas Police Officer John R. Pasco. Pasco was shot once in the head after chasing Montoya in the vicinity of the Spanish Villa Apartments at 1818 Park Ave. He had gone to the apartments to check out residents' complaints about an armed man. Police said Montoya fired at Pacso's squad car as it pulled into the complex, but did not hit the officer. Pasco called for help on the car radio and then gave chase on foot. Montoya said he ran from the patrolman to avoid being arrested for carrying a weapon. He said he fell during the chase and the gun fired while he was attempting to throw the weapon away.
