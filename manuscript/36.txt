**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the March 1983 shooting death of Larry Don Rohus during a robbery of offices inside the International Trade Center Building in Houston. Rohus, district manager for the Union Life Insurance Company, and another employee were in the company's cashier's office when Smith approached with a pistol and demanded money. When the second employee fled behind a filing cabinet, Rohus complied with Smith's instructions and placed an undetermined amount of money inside a small trash can and placed it on a table near the robber. As Rohus began to walk away, Smith called him back and fired a shot as Smith pleaded for his life. Rohus ran, but was shot through the heart and died. Smith was arrested a short time later in a nearby apartment complex after being pursued on foot by one of Rohus' co-workers, a businessman on the street and a crew of workers.
