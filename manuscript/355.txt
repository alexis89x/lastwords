# November 16 - Thomas, Shannon

**Date of Birth**: July 27  

**Date of Offense**: December 24  

**Date of execution**: November 16  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the December 1993 of three people, including two children, at a Baytown residence. Killed inside their home at 2204 Maryland were Roberto Rios and his two children, Victor Roberto Rios, 11, and Maria Elda Isbell Rios, 10. Thomas and co-defendant Keith Clay went to the Rios home to rob him of marijuana and money he had from selling small amounts of drugs. Known as the "Vato Man", Roberto was shot and stabbed to death and then Thomas went upstairs and shot his children execution style so there would be no witnesses. Thomas later told his friends and associates what he had done.

**Last statement**  
Yes. Man, I just want you to know how much I love them. I want you to be strong and get through this time. Do not fall back. Keep going forward. Don't let this hinder you. Let everybody know I love them (several names listed), Kevin - as well as everyone else in the family. Tell them that I love them and stay strong. This is kind of hard to put words together; I am nervous and it is hard to put my thoughts together. Sometimes you don't know what to say; I hope these words give you comfort. I don't know what to say. I want you to know I love you; just stay strong and don't give up. Let everybody know I love them...and love is unconditional, as Mama has always told us. I may be gone in the flesh, but I am always with you in spirit. I love you.
