**Summary of Incident**  
Sentenced to death for the murder of San Antonio convenience store February 11, 1981. Williams was convicted of shooting Daniel Liepold in the back with a .38 caliber pistol during a robbery attempt at the Circle K Food Store, where Williams once worked. At his trial, eyewitnesses testified they had seen Williams and his accomplice, Theodore Roosevelt Edwards, in the store at the time of robbery and prosecutors introduced a confession signed by Williams some eight hours after the crime. Authorities found the gun used in the store robbery at his parents' home on a nightstand next to a bed Williams was sleeping in. Williams married at 17 and was separated from his wife when the crime took place. He had worked as a clerk at the Circle K Food Store for about a year, taking home $180 a week, and knew Liepold casually, he said.
