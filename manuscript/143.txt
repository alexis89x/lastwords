**Date of execution**: November 21, 1997  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery-murder of 38-year-old Janet Caldwell outside a grocery store in Houston. Livingston reportedly drove to the Weingarten's store at W. 43rd St. and waited until he saw a woman, alone, drive up to the store and park. When Caldwell went inside, Livingston crawled underneath her van and waited until she returned with an armload of groceries. He then crawled from underneath the van, pointed a 9mm pistol at her and attempted to steal her purse. As the two struggled, Livingston shot Caldwell twice in the throat and fled with her purse. He was apprehended a short time later and identified by the witnesses.

You all brought me here to be executed, not to make a speech. That's it.
