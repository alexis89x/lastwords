**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the August 1986 rape and slaying of Marguerite Lucille Dixon, a 53-vear-old registered nurse living in Hockley. Richards, paroled from prison just two months earlier, approached Dixon's son outside her home and asked if a van parked in the driveway was for sale. When told the van was not for sale, Richards left, but returned to the home when he saw Dixon's son and daughter leave. He forced the victim into a bedroom, sexually assaulted her, and then shot her in the head with a .25 caliber pistol. After the killing, Richards stole two televisions from the home and the van from the driveway. He later traded the murder weapon to a friend in exchange for cocaine. Richards� fingerprint was found on a sliding glass door to Dixon�s home. He later confessed to the killing, but claimed the gun discharged accidently.
