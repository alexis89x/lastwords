**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the execution-style slaying of three men at the Hilltop Grocery, a rural country store near the communities of McKinney and Princeton. Killed were store owner Preston Broyles, 73, and store customers Gary Coker and Billy St John, both 18 and residents of Princeton. All three were riddled with bullets from a 30-caliber machine gun stolen a day earlier from a Waco gun collector, who was found stabbed to death in his apartment. White and two accomplices left the store with $6 taken from the cash register and about $60 taken from the wallets of the victims. While White confessed to shooting all three men, he was tried and convicted only in Broylesï¿½ death. White is the longest serving death row inmate in Texas.
