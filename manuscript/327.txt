**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the August 1992 shooting deaths of Edward Perry Haden and Helen O'Sullivan in Houston. Green and co-defendant Jimmy Lee Daniels spotted the victims stopped at a traffic light and decided to rob them for "weed" money. Green jumped from the car Daniels was driving and pointed a gun at Haden, who was seated on the passenger side of the car driven by O'Sullivan. When Haden failed to react quickly to Green's threats, Green fired three times through the window, striking Haden twice and O'Sullivan once.

**Last statement**
Yes I do. To my family, to my friends, and people who have accepted me for being the person that I am. To the Sullivan and Hayden families, I do not come here with the intention to make myself out to be a person that I am not. I never claimed to be the best person. I am not the best father, the best son, or the best friend in the world. I did the best I could with what I had. I come with no hate in my heart or bitterness. To my family and to you people, I can only apologize for all the pain I caused you. May God forgive us on this day. I am ready when you are.
