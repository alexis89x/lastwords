**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the December 1986 slayings of 26-year-old Carol Lynette Huckabee and 29-year-old Eva Marie DeForest, two Lubbock waitresses who shared an apartment at 4614 67th St. Both women were bound by duct tape inside their apartment and stabbed repeatedly. Huckabee, who reportedly was also raped, suffered multiple stab wounds to the chest, back, and face and her throat was slashed. DeForest was beaten, stabbed 41 times in the chest and her throat cut. A broken knife blade was found sticking out of her chest. Joiner lived next door to the women and told police he saw two black men running from the apartment after discovering their bodies. He was arrested after telling police conflicting stories about how he found the murdered women.

**Last statement**  
Kathy, y'all take and I bless all of you and I am glad I have had y'all in my life. As I have said from the very first thing, I am innocent of this crime and God knows I am innocent and the four people that was murdered know I am innocent and when I get to heaven I'll be hunting you and we'll talk. I feel sorry for the families that's had to suffer and my family and I have 'em all in my prayers. I love you all. Y'all take and y'all look after Sheila and Shannon and them, call 'em and get the pictures to 'em and everything and, ah, again, like I said, I feel sorry for the families, but if it takes my death to make them happy, then I will bless them. I have no hard feelings toward anyone cause the Lord feels that it is my time to come home to Him, my work on earth is done and that, ah, like I said, I am just sorry for, but they will have to go through this one time again, cause sooner or later, whoever did this crime is going to be caught and they'll have to come down here and do this again and they will realize they witnessed an innocent man going to be with Jesus Christ.
