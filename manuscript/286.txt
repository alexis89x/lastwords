**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the December 1989 murder of Houston police officer James C. Boswell. Officer Boswell and his partner were working a minor traffic violation on South Main Street across from the Astromotor Inn when Ogan approached the officers and demanded their attention. Ogan said he was an informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency and needed their help. Boswell told Ogan they would help him as soon as they finished with the traffic violator. Ogan. however, demanded immediate attention. Relenting to Oman's persistence, Boswell began to unlock the rear door to the patrol car. As he did, Ogan shot the officer once in the left temple. Ogan attempted to flee on foot but was shot once in the lower back by Boswellï¿½s partner. At the time of his arrest, Ogan, who had worked as a DEA informant since January 1988, had a sawed-off shotgun, two pistols and several knives in his apartment. He also had a human target on the walls with numerous bullet holes to the head.

The people responsible for killing me will have blood on their hands for an unprovoked murder. I am not guilty; I acted in self-defense and reflex in the face of a police officer who was out of control. James Boswell had his head beat in; possibly due to this he had problems. My jurors had not heard about that. They did not know he had suffered a head injury from the beating by a crack dealer five months earlier; that he was filled with anger and wrote an angry letter to the Houston Chronicle. He expressed his frustration at the mayor, police chief and fire chief. He was mad at the world. Three and a half months before I worked on a deal with the DEA, the informant was let off. At the moment he left the courtroom, he became angry with me; Officer Boswell was upset about this. Officer Boswell and an angry woman were in the police car and they were talking in raised voices. In other words, Officer Boswell was angry at the time I walked up. Officer Boswell may have reacted to the...(Offender stopped speaking in mid-sentence.)
