Mayfield was abducted from BJ's Lounge and shot twice in the head with a .38-caliber pistol after being forced to drive James around three southeast Texas counties while he raped a 23-year-old convenience store clerk he had earlier robbed of $300 and kidnapped. The clerk, a black female who worked at the Porter's Get It & Go store in Winnie, was shot three times in the head, but survived to identify James. Both women were found lying on Russell's Landing Road in Jefferson County.
