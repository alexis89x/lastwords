**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the kidnapping and murder of 5-year-old Audra Reeves of Amarillo. In a written confession, Anderson told police that he kidnapped Reeves from in front of his home at 3310 W. 2nd Street as she returned from playing with other children at San Jacinto Park. He took her inside where he attempted to rape her. Unsuccessful in his sexual assault, Anderson beat, stabbed, and drowned the young girl. He placed her body in an styrofoam ice chest and carried it in a grocery cart to a garbage dumpster behind a residence at 410 S. Tennessee St. The ice chest containing the girl's nude body was found in the dumpster by a homeowner throwing out his trash. Anderson said he kidnapped and killed the girl after arguing with his wife about infidelity.

**Last statement**  
Yes, I would like to make a short brief one please. To Audrey's grandmother, I am sorry for the pain I have caused you for the last 15 years and your family. I have regretted this for a long time. I am sorry. I only ask that you remember the Lord because He remembers us and He forgives us if we ask Him. I am sorry. And to my family, and my loved ones - I am sorry for the pain for all those years and for putting you through all the things we had to go through. I ask the Lord to bless you all. Tammy, Irene, Betty, Dan Judy - I love you all. And Jack, thank you. Warden...
