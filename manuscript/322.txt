**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the killings of Louis Oates, the 63-year-old owner of Oates Oil Co. in Palestine, and business secretary Dorothy Harris, 41. Oates was standing on the loading dock of his business at 507 w. Reagan when Patterson walked up behind him and shot him with a .38-caliber pistol. Patterson walked away after the shooting but returned to shoot Harris in the head when she came outside and began screaming. Patterson then walked a short distance to a friend's house, put down the gun, and took off his clothes. He was standing naked in the street when arrested. A motive in the murders was unclear, but a friend of Oates told police that Patterson and the victim had once argued over who was a better football player.
