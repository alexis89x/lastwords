**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the July 1995 murder of infant Lacey Anderson during a shooting rampage at a Fort Worth apartment complex. Lacey, age 20 months, was one of six people shot by Wheat, three fatally, at the Les Jardin Apartments at 2901 Travis Avenue after Wheat argued with the victim's mother over claims that he had sexually fondled Lacey's 6-year-old sister Ashley Ochoa the previous day. Ashley and her 8-year-old brother Edwardo Ochoa were also fatally shot in the head by Wheat with a^ .45 caliber pistol. Records indicate that Angela Anderson, mother of the three children, said in a note she had Edwardo deliver to Wheat the day of the shooting that Ashley claimed he had put his hand down her shorts and that he would be reported to police. Wheat argued with Anderson and shot at her as she walked upstairs to call police. Wheat chased Anderson into an apartment and shot her three times as she tried to hide in a bedroom closet. Wheat then went to Anderson�s apartment and fatally shot each of her children in a rear bedroom. After shooting the children, Wheat retrieved a carabine rifle and fired into the apartment of Jessie Cranfill, the complex�s 33-year-old security guard, wounding him in the back and leg. Tenant Juan Ramirez, 19, was also wounded by shots fired by Wheat at random. As Fort Worth police responded to the scene, officer Angela Jay was struck several times as she entered the complex. As other officers converged on Wheat, he put down his weapons and surrendered.
