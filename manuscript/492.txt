**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the September 1988 stabbing deaths of 15-year-old Shandra Charles and her 3-year-old cousin Marcell Taylor. The two victims were found lying on a dirt path behind a Houston restaurant. Charles was still alive and told police that "Preston tried to rape me". Lab tests later revealed that the girl had been raped. The girl's dying statement led police to an apartment complex at the end of the dirt path. Hughes was the only "Preston" living there, and police found the girl's eyeglasses in the apartment and evidence of blood on his clothing. Hughes gave two statements to police before finally admitting to the murders. Both victims died of stab wounds.
