## Summary of Incident
Convicted in the March 1974 abduction and shooting death of 24-year-old Thomas Robert Stearns of Houston. Stearns, manager of a Radio Shack store at 10810 W. Bellfort, was abducted after leaving his home and driven to a wooded area near Areola, where he was shot twice in the head. Trial testimony indicated Russell killed Stearns because Stearns was a witness to an April 1972 robbery of the same Radio Shack store by Russell. Russell was out of jail on bond when Stearns was killed. He was convicted in March 1977 of robbery and given a 50-year prison sentence based on testimony given by Stearns during a 1972 examining trial.
