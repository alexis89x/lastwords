# December 11 - Kinnamon, Raymond

**Date of Birth**: November 20  

**Date of Offense**: December 11  

**Date of execution**: December 11  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the December 1984 robbery and slaying of 41-year-old Ronald Charles Longmire at NJ's, a bar in the 3800 block of Mangum in Houston. Kinnamon was in the bar drinking when he pulled a pistol and demanded money from customers and employees. He took more than $1,500, including $250 from Longmire. Longmire was shot once in the back when he reportedly slapped Kinnamon's hand away when the robber touched his back pocket, asking him what was in it. Kinnamon fled and was arrested about two weeks later as a result of a tip from a police informant.

**Last statement**  
'guys like them got tied up in something like this. Thank Chaplain Taylor and Jane. I just got your letter. Thanks to Carolyn and Gloria, who have been my friends for over four years. I want to remember Patsy Buntion, Gladys and a lot more friends. I want to thank the prosecutor in my case; it took courage for him to do what he did but he did what he did because he believed in the judicial system.  
I'm not ready to go, but I have no choice; I sent several letters to my family; they'll be very moving when you get them. I want to say goodbye again to my boys. I know I'm missing somebody, but if there's anything I have left to say, it would be that I wish I had a Shakespearean vocabulary, but since I was raised in TDC, I missed out on some of my vocabulary.  
If my words can persuade you to discontinue this practice of executing people, please do so. If the citizens don't do away with the death penalty, Texas won't be a safe place to be. I have no revenge because hate won't solve anything.  
(I gave Warden Hodges the phone at this time and he listened for 5-10 minutes. When he returned the phone to me, I could hear Kinnamon talking but evidently the phone was not close to the mike, because I could not understand him.)
