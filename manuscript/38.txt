**Summary of Incident**  
Buxton was convicted of capital murder in the September 19, 1980 shooting death of Joel Slotnifc during a grocery store robbery in Houston. Buxton and two unknown co-defendants robbed the Safeway store at Fry Road and I-10 West. After the robbers had taken money from a cash register and left for the getaway car, Buxton shot Slotnick, a customer, because his five-year-old son, Aaron, would not get down on the floor as ordered. Slotnik died on September 23, 1980 from a neck wound.

I'm ready, Warden.
