**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Shakeitha Shanta Carrier of Crosby. Whitaker had been dating the victim's sister who had recently left him because of his abusive behavior. On the day of the murder, Whitaker drove to his former girlfriend's parents home outside Crosby and told her mother, Mary, that he was returning some of her belongings. Told to leave them on the porch, Whitaker pulled a .45 caliber pistol and forced his way inside. Whitaker forced Mrs. Carrier and her 5-year-old daughter Ashley into the living room where he shot Mrs. Carrier once in the chest. Whitaker followed the fleeing Ashley upstairs where he confronted Shakeitha and shot her once in the head. Whitaker then pistol whipped Ashley, fracturing her skull in two places. Returning downstairs, Whitaker saw Mrs Carrier fleeing through the front door. Retrieving more bullets from his vehicle, Whitaker cornered Mrs Carrier behind the house and shot her a second time in the chest. Both Mrs Carrier and Ashley survived their wounds, although Mrs. Carrier suffers from partial paralysis in her right arm and hand. Shakeitha died at the scene. Whitaker was traced to his apartment where he attempted to allude police by jumping out a window. Police shot him in the hip when he appeared to be reaching for his pistol.
