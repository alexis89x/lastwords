**Summary of Incident**  
Hammond was convicted of capital murder in the death of 21-year-old Donna Lynn Vetter in San Antonio on Sept. 4, 1986. Vetter, an FBI secretary, was raped and stabbed to death after Hammond broke into her apartment at 4848 Goldfield sometime between 9:30 and 10:55 p.m. Police said Hammond pulled the screen from the front window and surprised Vetter. She was stabbed once in the chest with a knife from her kitchen and sexually assaulted. Hammond's prints were found on an end table and on the murder weapon. A few hours after he was convicted of capital murder on March 30, Hammond escaped from the Bexar County Jail when a jailer left open a door separating a second-floor holding area and a visitation area. He was recaptured the following evening when police spotted him running across a street. Two jailers and two sergeants were fired for allowing Hammond to escape.
