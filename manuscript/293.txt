**Date of Birth**: March 22  

**Date of Offense**: October 16  

**Date of execution**: January 28  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery and murder of David Vela, a clerk at the Texaco convenience store at 6105 Techni Center Drive in Austin. Vela, 20, was shot five times execution-style after Curry and accomplice Mark Davis busted out the store window and demanded money at gunpoint. The murder/robbery netted the bandits $220 from the cash register. Police arrested the two after viewing a videotape of the incident captured by a hidden camera. Curry is also serving a life sentence in connection with the Oct. 23, 1991 robbery and murder of Brendon Proske, a clerk at the Payless convenience store at 9704 Giles Lane in Austin. Proske, 23, was killed in much the same fashion as Vela in a robbery that netted $71.15.

**Last statement**  
I pray with the help of God that you will forgive me for the pain I caused your family. I am truly sorry. I wish I could take it back, but I just pray and ask that you forgive me.
