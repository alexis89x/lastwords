**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the death of 26-year-old Michael R. Trekell and Jayson Keller, a 17-week-old infant. Trekell and the infant were two of four people killed during a 7-hour murder spree by Bigby in Fort Worth and Arlington. Trekell, who had befriended Bigby, was shot in the head with a .357 caliber pistol inside the trailer home he shared with Grace Kehler ad 2108 Lamplighter in Arlington. Bigby suffocated the couple's young son with a piece of cellophane and then placed the child face down in a water-filled sink.

Bigby was arrested after an apparent suicide attempt on December 26. He had earlier vowed to go out in a "blaze of glory".

**Last statement**  
Yes, I do, Grace Kehler is that you? I have given Warden Jones a written statement that will explain a lot more. I hope this will bring you closure and answers to some questions. I hope this will bring you peace and I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering. I'm sorry it went on for a terribly long time. I'm sorry to you especially Grace Kehler. To the Kehler, Johnson and Crain family, I pray that you won't hate Jesus, the letter will explain more. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hope that my death will bring you peace and closure. I pray that maybe someday will bring you peace. I hope that you could forgive me, but if you don't I understand. I don't think I could forgive anyone who would of killed my children. I'm sorry for your suffering you've had for a long time. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I love you Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus.
