**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the rape and strangulation of Barbara Jackson Pullins inside her Houston apartment. Williams forced his way inside Pullins' apartment at knifepoint, forced her to disrobe, and raped her. He then tried to suffocate her by placing a plastic bag over her head. When that failed, he strangled her with a telephone cord. After burning her body with a cigarette to make sure she was dead, Williams attempted to set her body afire by igniting a roll of paper towels. Williams then moved to a bedroom where he found the victim's 9-year-old daughter. She was raped and beaten, but survived to ID Williams. Williams took several items from the apartment and drove.

**Last statement**  
The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters, He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me, in the presence of mine enemies. He anointeth my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever. Amen. Amen.
