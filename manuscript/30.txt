**Summary of Incident**  
April 10 , 1978 King bludgeoned Michael Clayton Underwood to death with the butt of a shotgun. Underwood and his girlfriend were abducted outside a Montrose area nightclub. Evidence in the trial showed King and his companion accosted Underwood and his girlfriend at gunpoint. Enraged because the two had only $11.50 between them, the men took Underwood to a remote area and killed him in front of the woman, who was repeatedly raped by her attackers. Underwoods girl friend, Kelly Brei, 19, survived the attack.
