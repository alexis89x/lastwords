**Last statement**  
First I would like to praise my Lord Jesus Christ.  I ask for forgiveness to the Thomas Family for my past choices I made.  Carol did not deserve for what I’ve done.  I’ve asked God to forgive me.  Please find it in your hearts to forgive me.  I’m sorry it has been bothering me for a long time.  So I now pray and I will keep you all in my prayers.  I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me.  I’m sorry. To my supporters Daniel, brother Charlie, Steve and all who stood by me, thank you.  By no means am I happy for what I’ve done.  I have asked the Lord to forgive me.  Please tell everyone I’m certain I left off some names.  Tell my kids I’m sorry for being a disappointment.  Thank you. God bless.  I’m ready warden.
