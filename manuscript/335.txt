**Summary of Incident**  
On September 28, 1996 in Houston, McWilliams murdered an Hispanic male during a robbery. McWilliams and his accomplices were driving around Houston looking for a car to steal for use in robberies when they happened upon the victim asleep inside his parked car. Shaking him from his sleep, McWilliams and his accomplices attempted to put the victim in the trunk of his car. When he resisted, McWilliams shot him once in the head at point-blank range. The killing occurred in the middle of a crime spree by McWilliams and accomplices in Waller and Harris counties.

**Last statement**  
Yes. Well here we are again folks, in the catacombs of justice. You know there is a lot I wanted to say - a lot I thought I'd say - but there is not a whole lot to say. There are people that will be mad thinking I try to seek freedom from this, but as long as I see - freedom belongs to me and I'll keep on keeping on. The shackles and chains that just might hold my body can't hold my mind, but will kill me otherwise. I love you momma, and Misty and Annette, Brenda and Anthony - and all my friends and everybody that supported me. I leave my love here; I am never going to stop loving you. My love is going to stay here.
