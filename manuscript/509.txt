**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the shooting death of Houston police officer Guy P. Gaddis. Officer Gaddis was flagged down outside a southwest Houston nightclub by a man Tamayo had robbed minutes earlier. Officer Gaddis, 24, arrested and handcuffed Tamayo and was transporting him to jail when Tamayo pulled a pistol that had gone unseen and shot the officer three times in the back of the head. The officer's patrol car ran off the road into a house, at which time Tamayo kicked out a window and fled, still handcuffed. He was arrested several blocks away. Tamayo told investigators that he was angry with officer Gaddis because he wouldn't allow him to leave his keys with his wife before being transported to jail.
