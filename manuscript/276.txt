**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery and murder of 75-year-old Willard Lewis Davis of Longview. Jones and three accomplices pulled Davis from his vehicle as he was backing out of the driveway from his home at 112 W. Edgefield in an attempt to rob him. When Davis resisted, Jones shot him once in the head with a .357 magnum pistol. Leaving his body in the roadway, the four bandits fled in Davis' vehicle. They were arrested a short time later after wrecking the car. All gave written confessions to police.
