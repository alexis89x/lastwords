**Last statement**  
Yes. Yes, I do. Do I just talk to the front? O.K. To everybody on both sides of that wall--I want you to know I love you. I am sorry that the child had to lose her life, but I should not have to be here. Tell my family I love them all and I will see them in Heaven. Come home when you can. I am done. Love you all.
