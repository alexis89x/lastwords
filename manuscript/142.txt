**Date of Birth**: April 24  

**Date of Offense**: June 11  

**Date of execution**: November 19  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the June 1982 abduction and stabbing death of 31-year-old Brenda Kay Broadway of Kermit. Broadway and her two daughters, ages 8 and 15, were reportedly abducted from a car wash and driven to a remote location in Ector County where they were sexually abused. Broadway and her 8-year-old daughter, Christie Michelle Elms, were then stabbed to death. Broadway's other daughter managed to escape during the stabbings. Naked and with her arms bound, she ran five miles through the desert before finding help at an oil rig. The bodies of the two victims were found buried in a shallow grave. Sharp was arrested five days after the bodies were found. In November 1982, Sharp was convicted of murder in Christie Elms' death and sentenced to life in prison. He is also a suspect in several other West Texas killings. In late November 1982, he led police to the grave.

**Last statement**  
Yes, I do. I would like to tell the surviving victims here, society, my family and friends, that I ask that they forgive me for anything I have done. I beg for your forgiveness. I would like to ask the Lord Jesus Christ for forgiveness and say that in spite of my circumstances, I have been blessed by Him. My first thought is that Jesus Christ came down and separated the humans from God. I would like to see that wall that separates these groups here tonight brought down and that we would all have love and compassion for one another and that you all build a future for all of us. There are a lot of men on the Row who need to be remembered. I love all'
