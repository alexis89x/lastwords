**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the May 1986 slaying and robbery of 20-year-old Paul Manier at Manier's North Harris County apartment. Miniel and co-defendant James Russell reportedly met Manier's roommate in Galveston and returned the apartment at 220 North Point to drink beer and smoke marijuana. When Manier's roommate fell asleep, Miniel and Russell attacked the victim, striking him in the head with a heavy glass beer mug, stabbing him 39 times in the neck and back with knives, and beating him about the head with a automobile shock absorber. Miniel and Russell then stole the victim's wallet, which contained $20, and a stereo system from the apartment. They then reportedly cleaned up and went out for a hamburger. Miniel fled to Indiana and then to Chicago, Illinois where he was arrested May 22, 1986 while in possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Part of the stolen stereo system was recovered in Chicago from a neighbor of Miniel who bought it from him for $100. The rest of the stereo system was recovered in Huntsville, Tx. after Miniel gave police an oral confession. Russell, who fled to Brookshire, Tx. following the murder, testified against Miniel in exchange for a 50-year prison sentence.  
James Warren Russell, Jr., #468362, W/M, DOB: 6-21-64. Received 12-14-87 from Harris Co. with 50-year sentence for murder w/deadly weapon.
