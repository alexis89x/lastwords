**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the abduction, rape and murder of 24-year-old Kelly Elizabeth Donovan, a senior airman stationed at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. Donovan was abducted by Cruz and co-defendant Jerry Daren Kemplin after she had left the base to take a walk. She was driven to an isolated area off FM 1604 in the western part of the county where she was sexually assaulted and then stabbed to death. Cruz and Kemplin later told police that they decided to kill Donovan so she couldn't testify against them in her abduction and rape.

**Last statement**  
First of all, I want to apologize to the family of Kelly Elizabeth Donovan. I am sorry for what I did to her twelve years ago. I wish they could forgive me for what I did. I am sorry. I am sorry for hurting my family, for hurting my friends. Jesus forgive me. Take me home with you. I am ready. I love you all.
