**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the murder of Benjamin Garza outside a Houston shopping center. Garza was in his car outside the shopping center in southwest Houston waiting for his wife and children when Shannon entered the passenger side. After a brief struggle, Shannon shot Garza in the head, kicked him out of the vehicle, and drove off. Shannon was arrested later in Beaumont after being spotted driving the stolen car. Police said Shannon had raped a maid at a nearby motel just 10 minutes before he killed Garza.

**Last statement**  
All praises be to God. I would like to say to the Garza family, see my smile, it is not from happiness. I took a father, it wasn't my fault, it was an accident... God knows the truth. If my life could bring your father back, then let it be. Don't take my smile for Disrespect. If I see your father I will ask him forgiveness. I told the Judge the truth it was an accident. I'll smile and I am not sad. If my life could make you happy, be free. I'll say when I see him I'm sorry. I have no anger nor fear. Mom have no fear. Mommy I will be home when I get there.
