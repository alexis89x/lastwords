**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the November 1993 murder of 23-year-old Nicholus West in Tvler.

West's half-naked, bullet-riddled body was found in a clay pit about 10 miles outside of Tyler. Aldrich and his co-defendants were said to have been involved in earlier drive-by shootings, robberies, burglaries, car-jackings, arson and gay bashing.

Yes sir, I would. To the West Family, I would just like to apologize for your loss. I hope that you can forgive me. To my family and loved ones and friends, I thank all of you all for your support and I am sorry for the pain and hurt I have caused you. I love you all and I will see you on the other side. O.K. Warden.
