**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the murders of Gunar Nelson Fulk, 16, and Leroy McCaffrey, Jr., 17. Johnson approached the victims at a convenience store at FM 2920 and FM 249 in Tomball and asked them for a ride. Approximately four miles away from the store, Johnson forced the two out of the vehicle at gunpoint and shot them several times. McCaffrey was chased some 350 feet before he was caught and killed by Johnson, who then stole Fulk's truck and drove to Austin where he told his girlfriend that he has killed two boys. He later abandoned the truck in San Marcos and traded the murder weapon for cocaine. He was arrested 14 days later and claimed self-defense.
