**Summary of Incident**  
Mann was convicted of capital murder in the Sept. 11, 1980 shooting death of Christopher Lee Bates in Dallas County. Mann and a companion entered an apartment where Bates, his roommate Robert Matzig, and a woman, Barbara Hoppe, were watching a football game. Both Bates and Matzig were robbed and Hoppe was raped before being strangled and stabbed to death. Bates and Matzig were driven to grocery stores where they cashed two checks and gave the money to the intruders. They were then driven to a secluded area where  
Bates was shot in the head. Matzig was shot in the neck, but survived. Mann said he and his accomplice went to the victims' apartment because he and his accomplice "needed the money and knew they had cocaine."

**Last statement**  
I would like to tell my family I love them. My attorneys did their best. All of my brothers on death row, those who died and those who are still there, to hang in there. And that's all I have to say.
