**Last statement**  
When asked if he had a last statement, he replied, "Yes, I do. I hope that one day we can look back on the evil that we're doing right now like the witches we burned at the stake. I want everybody to know that I hold nothing against them. I forgive them all. I hope everybody I've done anything to will forgive me. I've been praying all day for Carl Levin's wife to drive the bitterness from her heart because that bitterness that's in her heart will send her to Hell just as surely as any other sin. I'm sorry for everything I've ever done to anybody. I hope they'll forgive me. "Sharon, tell all my friends goodbye. You know who they are: Charles Bass, David Powell'" Then he coughed and nothing else was said.
