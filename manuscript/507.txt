**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the kidnapping and murder of 20-year-old Michael Keith Dwyer. McCoskey abducted Dwyer and his 19-year-old fiancee from Dwyer's apartment and forced them to an abandoned house at 1806 Drew in Houston where Dwyer was stabbed to death and his fiancee raped. McCoskey fled in Dwyer's car, but abandoned it in front of an apartment complex where he once lived. While police were searching the car, a resident, hearing a description of the suspect in the kidnapping, told them they were looking for McCoskey. He was later picked out of a lineup by Dwyer's fiancee.

**Last statement**  
The best time in my life is during this period. If I had to do again, I would not change a thing. I have been touched by an angel's wings. If I had it to do again, I would change Dwyer's parents suffering, because I know they are. I know that is not going to eliminate the pain, because I have a child. God, I want to say something so bad. I appreciate the people that helped me out. I appreciate the people that helped me out, and uh, know that I love you, Angel and your family and all the people that helped me out. And if this takes the pain away, so be it. I love you. I'm ready to go. '
