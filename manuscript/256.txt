Convicted in the February 1988 shooting death of Dallas Police Officer Gary D. McCarthy outside a Dallas supermarket. McCarthy was working off-duty security for Brancato's Supermarket and had just returned to the store from the bank with employee Mark DeCardenas when Cooks approached and demanded the money DeCardenas carried. DeCardenas told police that Cooks grabbed a money bundle amounting to $10,000 and then shot McCarthy before fleeing. McCarthy later died at Parkland Memorial Hospital. The following day, police arrested Tracy Dewayne Stallworth as as a suspect in the robbery and slaying. Stallworth named Cooks and Tony Ray Harvey as accomplices. A witness later picked out Cooks from a police lineup and identified him as the killer of Officer McCarthy.
