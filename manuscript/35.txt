Anderson, his sister, the victim's wife and her mother conspired to kill Goode to collect $67,000. Anderson was also named as a suspect in a December 1984 stabbing incident on Death Row. Death Row Kenneth D. Dunn was stabbed seven times in a dayroom after he and Anderson allegedly argued over a television program. Dunn, stabbed with a fan-guard, was treated at the unit and released back to his cell.

**Last statement**  
I would like to point out that I have written a statement and the Warden will give you a copy. I still proclaim I am innocent, and that's all I have to say.
