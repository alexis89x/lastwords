**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the October 1979 stabbing death of 19-year-old LaShan Muhlinghaus, a Texas A&M student, at her College Station apartment. Prosecutors said Emery hid in a closet and attacked Muhlinghaus when she walked in while he was burglarizing her apartment. After death, Muhlinghaus was sexually assaulted and her lower body mutilated. The case went unsolved for four years until Emery's ex-wife, Debra, went to police in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She later testified that her ex-husband came home the night of the murder covered with blood. Two of his friends testified that he admitted killing Muhlinghaus, a student from Rowlett. When charged with Muhlinghaus' murder, Emery was being held in St. Paul, Minnesota on three counts of burglary.
