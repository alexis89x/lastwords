**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the January 1995 shooting death of San Antonio Police Officer Fabian Dominguez, 29. Moore and two co-defendants had earlier burglarized the home of William Braden on Country Flower and returned to steal more items when Officer Dominguez spotted the three in the driveway and tried to stop them by pulling his weapon and ordering them out of their car. As Dominguez approached the car, Moore brushed his gun away and shot him in the face with a .25-caliber pistol he had pulled as the officer approached. Moore then grabbed the officer's pistol which had fallen into the front seat of the suspectsï¿½ car and shot Dominguez three more times in the head at close range as he lay helpless on the ground. Police later arrested Moore after a chase and he gave a full confession.

**Last statement**  
Jennifer, where are you at? I'm sorry, I did not know the man but for a few seconds before I shot him. It was done out of fear, stupidity, and immaturity. It wasn't until I got locked up and saw the newspaper. I saw his face and his smile and I knew he was a good man. I am sorry for all your family and my disrespect - he deserved better. Sorry Gus. I hope all the best for you and your daughters. I hope you have happiness from here on out. Quit the heroin and methadone. I love you dad, Devin, and Walt. We're done Warden.
