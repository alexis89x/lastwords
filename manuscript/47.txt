**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the August 1976 robbery-slaying of 65-year-old Martha Spinks, co-owner of a Houston furniture store. Spinks and her husband, Alge, were closing their store when White entered, pulled a pistol and demanded money. Without provocation, he then shot Mrs. Spinks once in the face at point blank range. White ordered Mr. Spinks to open the safe and then lie on the floor. When White dropped his pistol while attempting to steal rings and a watch from Mrs. Spinks' body, her husband grabbed the pistol and managed to fire two shots, striking White in the groin. White ran from the store, but was captured by police a quarter mile away after a car lot attendant who heard the shots flagged down a patrol car. Police found $269 in stolen money in White's pants pocket.
