## Summary of Incident
On November 13, 1997, in Channelview, Wesbrook was invited over to the residence of his ex-wife, a 32-year-old white female. Wesbrook believed this meeting was for a possible marital reconciliation, but when he arrived, there were others present. He sat around drinking with all of them. At some point in the evening, Wesbrook noticed that his ex-wife and two of the men had slipped away, and when he went into the bedroom, he found her having sex with both of the men. Wesbrook then went to his truck and pulled out his .36-caliber hunting rifle and returned to the residence. He then fatally shot his ex-wife and all three of the males in the residence. Another female was injured, but survived the shooting.
