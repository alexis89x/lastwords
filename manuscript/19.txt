**Summary of Incident**  
Evans was convicted of capital murder in the June 1977 shooting death of 36-year-old Elvira Guerrero during a robbery in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas. Guerrero, a pianist with the Second Mexican Baptist Church in Oak Cliff, was leaving church with friend Mario Garza when they were abducted by Evans and his co-defendant, Earl Stanley Smith. In a statement to police, Evans admitted robbing Guerrero of $40, shooting her twice and then cutting her face with a carpet knife as she prayed to God to forgive her attacker. Garza was also found shot to death.

**Last statement**  
I want to say I'm sorry for the things I've done and I hope I'm forgiven. I don't hold nothing against no one ' Everyone has treated me well and I know it's not easy for them ' That's all, I'm sorry.
