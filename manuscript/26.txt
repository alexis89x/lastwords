**Summary of Incident**  
Starvaggi was convicted in the Nov. 19, 1976 shooting death of 43-year-old John Denson, a Montgomery County juvenile probation officer and reserve deputy sheriff, during a burglary at the officer's home in Magnolia. Starvaggi admitted during his trial that he went to Denson's home with two accomplices to steal his gun collection. Starvaggi shot Denson when the officer struggled with one of the intruders and wrestled his gun away. Starvaggi said he then shot Denson two more times to "keep him from suffering." Denson suffered two wounds to the heart and one to the upper back. His 13-year-old daughter, who was taken upstairs with her mother, testified that she heard her father beg for mercy after he was shot once, saying, "I beg of you, don't do this." The accomplices reportedly urged Starvaggi to kill Denson's wife and daughter but he refused, saying he only killed "dopers and pigs."
