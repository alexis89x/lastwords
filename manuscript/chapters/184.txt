**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the May 1987 abduction and slaying of 9-year-old Kandy Janell Kirtland of Bryan. Kandy was abducted from her home at 3210 Deer Trail on May 12, 1987 after being dropped off by the school bus. Her parents found Kandy's backpack on the front porch, the front door open, and the keys to the home on the kitchen stove. Her decomposed body was found on Mav 26, 1987 along a creek in the 2500 block of E. Villa Maria Road. She had been shot once in the head after her hands had been tied behind her back with electrical cord. Earhart was arrested in Walker County's Stubblefield Lake Park the same day Kandy's body was found. Police learned Earhart had gone to the Kirtland home on May 4, 1987 in response to a newspaper ad about a paint spray gun for sale. He returned on the day disappeared, asking a neighbor when the Kirtlands would be home.
