Franklin was seen by two witnesses driving his car at a high rate of speed from the parking lot, where Moran's car was later found. Franklin was found at his home several hours later, after police traced the license number of his car. Police found his pants soaking in a pail of bloody water, found several of the nurse's personal items in a trash can. Five days later, Moran was found, nude and barely alive, in a field near the hospital. She suffered from irreversible shock and died the next morning.
