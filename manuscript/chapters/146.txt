**Date of Birth**: September 14, 1957  

**Date of Offense**: August 25, 1996  

**Date of execution**: February 09, 1998  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the August 1996 slaying of three people in Marshall during a shooting spree that also left a city police officer wounded. Killed were Renfro's common-law wife, Rhena Fultner, 36; his aunt, Rose Rutledge, 66, and an acquaintance, George Counts, 40. Renfro reportedly dressed in camouflage clothing and armed himself with assault weapons after claiming to have seen his common-law wife having sex with two unidentified men. He drove to the house they shared with his aunt at 614 N. Washington and shot Fultner once in the forehead. He then walked to his aunt's bedroom and shot her once in the head while she watched television in bed. Renfro shot Fultner a second time in the forehead when he found her still alive in the living room of the home. Renfro then went to Counts' trailer home at 1000 Calloway and fired a barrage of bullets into the structure when Counts refused him admittance. Counts' body was found just inside the door of the bullet-riddled trailer. Renfro said he killed Counts because he had once struck Fultner. Renfro then opened fire on the squad car of Marshall police officer Dominick Pondant and reserve officer George Gill as they responded to reports of shots being fired near the intersection of Main and Calloway streets. Pondant was hit by gunfire, but managed to exit his vehicle and return fire, wounding Renfro in the arm and abdomen. At the hospital, Renfro reportedly told police, "I killed them all. I killed my whole family".

**Last statement**  
I would like to tell the victims' families that I am sorry, very sorry. I am so sorry. Forgive me if you can.  
I know it's impossible, but try.  
Take my hand, Lord Jesus, I'm coming home.
