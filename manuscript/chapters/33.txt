**Date of execution**: December 07, 1989  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery-slaying of 24-year-old Wanda Jean Lopez, a Corpus Christi service station clerk. Police said Lopez was stabbed to death minutes after she phoned police and attempted to describe her assailant to the dispatcher. Her final words recorded by police were: "You want it (money). I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'm not going to do nothing to you. Please." DeLuna took an undetermined amount of money and fled on foot. Police found him hiding under a truck parked in the area. DeLuna contended that another person killed Lopez and that he ran so he would not be implicated.

**Last statement**  
I want to say I hold no grudges. I hate no one. I love my family. Tell everyone on death row to keep the faith and don't give up.
