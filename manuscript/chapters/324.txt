**Date of Offense**: April 17, 1995  

**Date of execution**: August 25, 2004  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the April 1995 shooting deaths of two teenagers inside a mobile, home near Jacksonville. Killed were 18-year-old Tenille Hamilton Thompson and 16-year-old Brandy Gray. A companion, 18-year-old Christopher Kelley was shot in the neck by Busby but survived his wound to identify his assailant. Busbym along with another teen and the three victims traveled to Tyler together in Kelley's truck the afternoon of the murder and ended up at the mobile home in the community of Antioch west of Jacksonville later that night. After smoking marijuana together, Busby walked outside and picked up an automatic assault rifle he had stolen earlier from his parents home in Tyler. When Kelley opened the door to the mobile home to walk outside, Busby shot him in the neck. Busby then walked in and shot Gray as she begged for her life. He then turned the rifle on Thompson as she huddled in a corner screaming, shooting her in the head. Busby took money from Kelley�s billfold and fled in Kelley�s truck to Jacksonville, throwing the rifle out along the way. He was arrested there and led police to the murder weapon. Busby said he shot the three only because he was high on drugs.

**Last statement**  
Yes I do. I want to tell everyone, my family, thanks for standing by me. I want to tell Mr. and Ms. Gray and everyone that I didn't do what I did to hurt you all. I am sorry that I did what I did. I don't think you know the true reason for doing what I did, but Brandy and I had a suicide pact and I just didn't follow through with it. That did not come out in the trial. I am not trying to hurt you by telling you this. I am trying to tell you the truth. I want Cindy to know that I know she is out there -- and Vicente Hernandez that I love them. Thank you for all you have done and I want to make sure you are alright. That is all I want to say. I am ready. See you later. I am ready.
