**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the March 1987 robbery and murder of 43-year-old Donald Franklin Johnson. Johnson's body was found wrapped in plastic inside a 55-gallon drum that had been filled with concrete and submerged in Amon Carter Lake in Montague County. The drum, labeled "Calcium Carbide" was found by a game warden five months following Johnson's disappearance. An autospy revealed that Johnson had been shot once in the head with a .25-caliber pistol. Johnson and Hill had previously been partners in several unsuccessful business ventures. Following Johnson's disappearance, Hill was seen in possession of his truck and camper trailer. Hill was also involved in the theft of equipment from Johnson's paint and body shop in Lubbock and the sale of the equipment at flea market.

**Last statement**  
First, I would like to tell my family that I love them. I will be waiting on them. I am fine. I hope that everyone gets some closure from this. I am innocent. Lubbock County officials believe I am guilty. I am not. Travis Ware has the burden on him to prove that he did not commit felonies. He needs to be stopped or he is going to do it time and time again. The power is invested in you as a public official to do your job. That's all Warden. I love y'all. June 25, 2008.
