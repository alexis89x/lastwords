## November 14 - Ramos, Robert Moreno

**Date of Birth**: May 23, 1954  

**Date of Offense**: July 02, 1992  

**Date of execution**: November 14, 2018  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the February 1992 slaying of his wife and two children inside the family's home in Progreso. All were beaten with a blunt object and died of skull fractures. Their bodies were found more than a month later buried beneath the bathroom floor of their home after Mrs. Ramos' sister reported them missing. Abigail's hand had been bound by tape and her mouth gagged prior to her death. Robert Ramos first told relatives that his family had died in an automobile accident, but couldn't say where. He later confessed, saying he fled to Arkansas after the murder and discarded the murder weapon, which was never found. Ramos married another woman three days after killing his family and moved her into the home where they were buried.

**Last statement**  
I am very thankful for all the hard work the Mexican consulate put in a fight over my death sentence if there was a reason or not. I am thankful for the humane treatment that I was given here at the 2 prisons that I was at. I am getting my gold watch that it took the Governor 30 years to forge. Thank you God, Lord send me a chariot. I'm ready.
