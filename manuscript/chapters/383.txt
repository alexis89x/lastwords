**Date of execution**: February 07, 2007  

**Summary of Incident**  
Jackson murdered his two stepdaughters at their home in Houston in April of 1997. Upset that the girl's mother planned to divorce him, Jackson asked each of his stepdaughters how they felt about the impending split. When one of the girls said she didn't care one way or the other, Jackson choked her to death with his arm. He asked the same question of the other girl when she returned home to the apartment, and also choked her to death even though she told him she loved him and wanted him to stay in her life. Jackson placed both girls in their beds and then strangled their mother when she returned home and spurned his advances and attempts at reconciliation.

**Last statement**  
You know, once upon a time diamonds were priceless. I never knew until I ran across my own. I just want Eve to know that. One of these days I'm going to return and get that for myself. Thank you to my family, I love you. Each and every one of you. This is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter for you and I together forever. I love you all. Remember what I told you Brad. Ms. Irene, God bless you, I love you. See you on the other side. Warden, murder me. Saddam and Gomorrah which is Harris County.
