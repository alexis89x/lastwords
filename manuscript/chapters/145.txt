## February 03 - Tucker, Karla

**Date of Birth**: November 18, 1959  

**Date of Offense**: June 13, 1983  

**Date of execution**: February 03, 1998  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the June 1983 pickax slaying of 27-year-old Jerry Lvnn Dean at the victim's apartment on Watonga Drive in northeast Houston. Dean and his companion, 32-year-old Deborah Thornton, were hacked to death after Tucker and accomplice Daniel Ryan Garrett sneaked into the apartment, supposedly to steal some motorcycle parts. Tucker testified that she and Garrett confronted Dean in the bedroom and that Garrett started beating Dean on the head with a hammer. Tucker said she heard a "gurgling sound" coming from Dean and struck him in the back with a pickax she spotted in the room to stop him from making the sound. Tucker turned the pickax on Thornton when she was discovered beneath a blanket. The bodies of both victims had more than 20 stab or puncture wounds, and the pickax was found embedded in Thornton's chest. Witnesses testified that Tucker later bragged about receiving gratification every time she hit her victims with the ax, a claim she later denied. She did admit to hating Dean because he had defaced photographs of her mother.
