**Last statement**  
Yes. The victim's family is not here so I won't address them. I want to thank my family and friends for everything. My wife, Ailsa, my sister-in-law, Laura - thank you for being here for me. I love you. And thanks for the friends at the Polunsky Unit that helped me get through this that didn't agree with my decision - and still gave me their friendship. I thank them. Warden...
