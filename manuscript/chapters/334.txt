**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the abduction and murder of 29-year-old Michael Burzinski. McCullum and three co-defendants accosted and then abducted Burzinski in the Montrose area of Houston, forcing him to drive to an ATM machine on Little York where $400 was withdrawn from his account. The accomplices then drove Burzinski in his car to an isolated area  
off Northview Park Drive where he was shot once in the back of the head while he pleaded for his life. The four then drove Burzinski's car a short distance away and set it afire. McCullum later confessed the killing to police.

**Last statement**  
I do. I just wanted to say to all of those that have supported me over the years that I appreciate it and I love you. And I just want to tell my mom that I love her and I will see her in Heaven.
