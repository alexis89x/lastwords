**Summary of Incident**  
On 09/13/98, in Georgetown, Granados went to his girlfriend's residence and an argument ensued. Grenados used a long kitchen knife and stabbed his girlfriend, requiring hospitalization. Grenados killed the girlfriend's 3-year old child with a large kitchen knife. On 09/14/98, the police officers were alerted due to a welfare concern for the 3-year old child and his mother, because their family had not seen them for a full day. When police officers arrived they were unable to get a response to their knocking and calling at the door. Officers called the residence, but the telephone was never answered. Upon entering the apartment after the door was broken down, they found the mother on the floor with several knife wounds. They then observed the child Anthony laying on the floor. Grenados entered the room through an open hallway and began shouting at the officers "Shoot me, just shoot me." The officers observed that Grenados had a gaping wound to his throat, both wrists and inside both elbows. Grenados continued to beg the officers to shoot him.

**Last statement**  
Yes, Love you mom, love you pop, love you Sara, and Amanda. Um, Cathy you know I never meant to hurt you. I gave you everything and that's what made me so angry. But I didn't mean to hurt you. I am sorry. That's it.
