**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the July 1983 robbery and murder of 21-year-old Christine Marie Sanchez of Corpus Christi. Sanchez was working alone at Greenhury's Jewelry Store, 912 Leopard, when Arnold entered with a pistol and demanded jewelry from a display case. Arnold told Texas Rangers in 1988 that he wrestled a .357 Magnum pistol away from Sanchez after she pulled it from a drawer and then shot her in the head as they struggled. Arnold left the store with numerous pieces of jewelry and fled to California where he was later arrested in Los Angeles for bank robbery.
