**Date of Birth**: July 31, 1952  

**Date of Offense**: September 29, 1987  

**Date of execution**: June 17, 1997  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the September 1987 abduction and slaying of three people in Aransas County. Victims David Magee, Virginia Cadena and Cadena's 10-year-old daughter Elizabeth Galvan were abducted from the Jackson Square Apartments in Aransas Pass and driven to a remote location near the intersection of FM 1069 and Johnson Road where they were shot to death with a .25-caliber pistol. Magee's hands and feet were bound by telephone and electrical cords, as were Cadena's hands. Her young daughter died from four bullet wounds to the abdomen. Johnson, who once worked for the same company as Magee, had recently been fired from his job and reportedly blamed Magee for his termination. The victims' bloodstained car was found parked at a nursing home close to Johnson's residence. Police also found Johnson's fingerprints at Magee's apartment and on a can inside the car. A pair of bloodsoaked blue jeans worn by Johnson were also recovered from a dumpster near his home.

**Last statement**  
I would like to say to the Magee family and the Cadena family that I was friends with David and Virginia and I did not commit this offense.  
I have tried to do something to compensate the families by writing a book. I would like for the proceeds to go to the Magee family and the Cadena family.  
There is someone who will be contacting them or they can get in touch with my attorney.  
I would like to thank you for standing by me and loving me and carry my best to my "sun," my butterfly.  
Goodbye, sun, I love you.
