**Summary of Incident**  
On 11/27/1994, Dickson and a juvenile accomplice robbed an Amarillo grocery store. The store owners, a 61 year old white male and his 60 year old white wife, were murdered during the robbery. Dickson and his half-brother entered the store and were attempting to steal beer when they were confronted by the male store owner. Dickson produced a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle from underneath his coat and shot the storeowner once in the chest. His wife was then shot in the face even though she had placed all the money from the store register on the counter for the robbers to take. The robbery netted $52 in cash and an undetermined amount of beer.

**Last statement**  
Yes, Sir I do. I'd like to say I love my mother, brother, sister, grandmother, cousins, and nieces, and my brothers and sisters I have never met. I do apologize to the Surace family. I am responsible for them losing their mother, their father, and their grandmother. I never meant for them to be taken. I am sorry for what I did and I take responsibility for what I did. That is all Warden.
