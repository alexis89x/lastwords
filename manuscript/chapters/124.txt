**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the September 1985 shooting death of 23-year-old David Wilburn Roberts, a Paris police officer. Rogers and co-defendant Willis Deron Cooper had robbed a Paris store of approximately $685 when their car was spotted and stopped by Officer Roberts at the entrance of the Ramada Inn in Paris. Before Officer Roberts could get out of his patrol car, Rogers reportedly got out of his vehicle and fired shots through the patrol car windshield. He then stepped to the driver's side window and fired four to six more times through the window. Officer Roberts died at the scene. Rogers and Cooper were arrested after robbing a Paris woman of her car and wedding ring and kidnapping another man. Seven witnesses identified Rogers as the killer of Roberts.
