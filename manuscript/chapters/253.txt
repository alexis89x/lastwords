**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the June 1985 robberv/slaying of 20-year-old Charles Marino in Houston. Marino and his brother-in-law, Kenneth Fleming, went to the Acres Home area of Houston to buy some marijuana and met Mitchell in a city park. He offered to sell them the drug, but then pulled a sawed-off shotgun on them and eventually forced them to drive to a vacant house at 8806 DePriest. After taking $25 and car keys from Marino, Mitchell forced him and Fleming to sit on the floor. He then shot them both with a 12-gauge shotgun from a distance of 10 feet. Left for dead with Marino, Fleming survived a gunshot wound to the hip. Mitchell was arrested in Corpus Christi seven days after the shooting. He was convicted of attempted capital murder in the Fleming shooting and given 60 years. He is also serving 60 years in the shooting death of Hector Manguia. Manguia was shot on the same day as Marino and Fleming when he refused to give Mitchell a necklace he demanded.
