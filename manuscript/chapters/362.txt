**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the robbery and murder of Jerome Samuel Harville in Houston. Kincy and his cousin and co-defendant Charlotte Marie Kincy went to Harville's home at 530 Grove with the intent to rob him. Harville, an Exxon employee, let the two inside because he know Charlotte. Once inside, Kevin Kincy pulled a .25 caliber revolver and shot Harville in the head. He and Charlotte then loaded up Harville's car with several items from the home, including stereo equipment, furniture, and a 9mm pistol, and fled. Kincy later bragged to friends about the killing and showed off  
the stolen pistol. He was finally arrested after leading police on a high speed chase from Orange TX. to Sulpher, LA.

That's it.
