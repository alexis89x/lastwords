**Date of Birth**: June 14, 1969  

**Date of Offense**: February 06, 1998  

**Date of execution**: June 12, 2013  

**Summary of Incident**  
On February 6, 1998, in Port Arthur, Chester broke into the residence of Kim Ryman Deleon. Chester raped her 14 year old and 16 year old daughters. Willie Ryman III (uncle to the girls) entered the home and was shot and killed by Chester. Chester took jewelry from the home and fled the scene. While in police custody, Chester confessed to this crime, two other murders, and three attempts to commit capital murder. Chester stated that he committed these offenses because he was out his mind "with hate for white people" due to a disagreement with a white staff member over a disciplinary report during a previous TDCJ incarceration.

**Last statement**  
I just want to say I don't want you to have hate in your heart for me, because I took your loved one. I know it doesn't mean anything; I told the truth because I feel like you should know who killed your loved one. God watches everything. Don't hate me, if you do, you'll have to deal with Him later. For me, live your life but don't hate me. I'm sorry for taking your loved one.  
Ms. Suzy, Susan, thank you for fighting for me in the courts. Thank you for supporting me for all these years. Elroy Chester wasn't a bad man, I knew me. A lot of people say I didn't commit those murders, I really did it.  
That's my statement. Warden, you can go ahead. '
