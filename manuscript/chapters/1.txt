**Last statement**  
*Statement to the Media*  
I, at this very moment, have absolutely no fear of what may happen to this body. My fear is for Allah, God only, who has at this moment the only power to determine if I should live or die... As a devout Muslim, I am taught and believe that this material life is only for the express purpose of preparing oneself for the real life that is to come... Since becoming Muslim, I have tried to live as Allah wanted me to live.  
*Spoken*  
Yes, I do.  
I love you.  
Asdadu an la ilah illa Allah,  
Asdadu an la ilah illa Allah,  
Asdadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah,  
Asdadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah.  
I bear witness that there is no God but Allah.  
I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.  
Inna li-Allah wa-inna ilayhi rajiun.  
Verily unto Allah do we belong, Verily unto him do we return.  
Be strong.
