On 9/21/1993 at 9:00 p.m. in Mesquite, Braziel approached a newlywed couple walking on a jogging trail of a community college. Braziel demanded money. When it was discovered that neither of the two had any money in their possession, Braziel shot the 27 year old white male, resulting in his death. Braziel then sexually assaulted the 23 year old white female. Braziel linked to the crime in January 2001 when his DNA was found to match the DNA taken from the female victim.

**Last statement**  
Yes Sir, I would like to thank the Shape Community Center for all their support. I would like to thank all those overseas, Italy and France, for their support for the death row prisoners. I would also like to apologize to Lori for the second time for her husband dying at my hand. To the White family and to Tashell for not being there, I Love you. Iâ€™m finished Warden you may proceed.
