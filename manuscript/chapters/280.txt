**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the beating deaths of 82-year-old Willie Simmons and his wife, Virginia Simmons, 66, inside their Dangerfield home. Walker told police that he had been smoking crack cocaine the night of the killings and went to the Simmons home at 503 Hill Street to rob the couple so he could buy more cocaine. Allowed inside by Mrs. Simmons, Walker, an acquaintance of the couple, pulled a club from the back of his pants and beat them to death. Virginia Simmons was also raped. Walker fled with Mr. Simmons' wallet containing $95. He was arrested when his bloodstained clothes were found in the woods behind his house.

**Last statement**  
Spoken: I would like to say goodbye to a good friend of mine in Switzerland - Diego. I appreciate all the help and support he gave me through the years. A friend of mine in England. Wildflower: I love you and will never forget you. And to my family. That's all. Written: I wish to tell the family how sorry I am about what I done. I know that nothing I say will bring Mr. and Mr. Bo Simmons back. I ask that if Linda and Gary and their family can find it in their hearts to forgive me, but if not, I will understand. I am truly sorry.
