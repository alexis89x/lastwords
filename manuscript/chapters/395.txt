**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the September 1990 robbery and murder of 22-year-old Tracy A Gee in Houston. Gee was stopped at a red light at the intersection of N. Braeswood and Rice Blvd. when Rodriguez and his cousin, James Gonzales pulled up next to her car. Rodriguez suddenly announced his intention to rob Gee, leveled a 30 caliber pistol across Gonzales' lap and fired once through the window, striking Gee in the temple. Rodriguez pushed Gee's body out onto the pavement and drove away in the victim's car, with Gonzales following. Gonzales was later stopped for driving with no taillights and told police that Rodriguez killed the young woman. Rodriguez was arrested four hours later in Fort Bend County while driving Geeï¿½s car. His pants were soaked with blood and he had brain matter in his hair. He gave a full confession.

**Last statement**  
First of all, you have every right to hate me and every right to want to see this. To you and to my family, you don't deserve to see this. I wasn't going to apologize by letter, I wanted to apologize face to face. None of this should have happened. It is the right thing to do. I have a good family, just like you are a good family. I hope that any bitterness that you have because of what I did, I hope you can learn to forgive. I asked my family to contact you, because they did no wrong. I am responsible and I am sorry to you all. Thank you all my Jefe (dad), my brothers, Maria and my Grandfather. Thank you, we will see each other again. Thank you, Lord Jesus receive my spirit.
