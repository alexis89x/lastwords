**Date of execution**: September 09, 1998  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the April 1985 robbery-slaying of 21-year-old Kevin Leroy Allen at a park near Fort Worth. Allen, a Fort Worth resident, was one of three men shot at Marion Sansom Park after Teague and accomplice Robin Scott Partine robbed Thomas Emmitt Cox (DOB: 4-12-63) and his date, an 18-year-old white female, at gunpoint. Cox had run over to the men's vehicle to ask for help when Teague and Partine robbed the couple of about $80 and then started to leave the park overlooking Lake Worth with the woman. At that point, Teague pulled up behind the men in the stolen pickup he was driving and shot each in the head with a .22-caliber pistol. Allen died at a local hospital of two gunshot wounds to the head. David Suson (DOB: 1-7-53) and James Bell (DOB: 12-20-54) recovered from head and facial wounds. Following the shootings, Cox's date (DOB: 12-20-66) was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by Teague and Partine. The two were arrested the following day after the woman was able to leave a note asking for help in a service station restroom near Ramah, Louisiana.
