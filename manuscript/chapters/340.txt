**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the October 1983 murder of Rozanne Gailiunasy 33, at her Richardson home. Hopper, who allegedly was paid $1,500 to kill Gailiunas for another man, forced his way into her home at gunpoint and attempted to sexually assault the woman after forcing her to remove her clothes and binding her to a bed. He then began to strangle Gailiunas with a rope but used his gun to shoot her twice through a pillow when she managed to free one of her hands and struggle with him. Hopper was arrested for the murder in December 1988 and confessed to the crime in February 1989. It was unclear whether the man identified as the solicitor of the murder was charged.

**Last statement**  
I want to apologize to you, and I am sorry. I have made a lot of mistakes in my life. The things I did changed so many lives. I can't take it back, it was an atrocity. I am sorry. I beg your forgiveness, I know I am not worthy of it. I love you Mom and Dad, and all my family. Thank you for everything. Jesus, thank you for your love and saving grace. Thank you for shedding your blood on Calvary for me. Thank you Jesus for the love you have shown me.
