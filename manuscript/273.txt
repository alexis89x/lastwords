**Date of execution**: 06/25/2002

**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the murders of Robin and Robert Wentworth, two five family members Coulson killed for inheritance. Coulson plotted over a 4-month period to kill his parents for their estate, and eventually decided to include his two sisters and brother-in-law as victims. Coulson went to his parents' home and lured each family member into separate rooms where he bound each with plastic flex cuffs and suffocated them by placing plastic bags over their heads and securing the bags with tape. He then doused the bodies and house with gasoline and ignited a fire in an effort to cover his crime. An
accomplice later confessed and led police to Coulson.

**Last statement**
I'm innocent. I had nothing to do with my family's murders. I want to thank everyone who has supported me. I hope they continue to fight. You know who you are. That's all. Thank you, Warden.
