**Summary of Incident**  
Hogue was convicted of capital murder in the January 1979 death of 27-year-old Jayne Markham in Arlington. Markham died in a house fire set by Hogue at 2412 Southcrest in Arlington. She had shared the rental house with her eight-year-old son and friends Mary Beth Crawford and Steve Renick. Hogue, who had lived in the same house a month before it was leased to the foursome in December 1978, apparently established some sort of amiable relationship with Markham and visited her on the last two days of her life. While Markham, Crawford and Hogue were eating breakfast on Jan. 12, he suddenly blurted out that he was a police officer and that he was arresting them for marijuana possession. Retrieving Renick's loaded pistol from a footlocker, Hogue later forced Crawford into an act of oral sodomy and then stabbed her in the stomach with a butcher knife. Markham was tied up and raped by Hogue prior to her death. Once Markham's son returned home from school and Renick returned from work, Hogue tied up or handcuffed the four inside the house and set it afire. All but Markham, whose hands and feet were tied behind her back with insulated wire, managed to escape. Hogue was arrested at a friend's home in Arlington on Jan. 14.

**Last statement**  
Mindy, I'm with you, honey. I do not know why, Mindy, you are doing this, but I will still forgive you. You know he is a murderer. Why don't you support me? He will do it again. Mindy, you are lucky you are still alive.  
Give my love to my family. I love them. Mindy, you can stop this.  
O.K., I'm ready.
