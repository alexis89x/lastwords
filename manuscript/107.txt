Convicted in the shooting death of 50-year-old William J. Veader in Amarillo. Veader died from a single gunshot wound to the head, which initially appeared to have been self-inflicted.

**Last statement**
There are people all over the world who face things worse than death on a daily basis, and in that sense I consider myself lucky.
I cannot find the words to express the sadness I feel for bringing this hurt and pain on my loved ones.
I will not ask forgiveness for the decisions I have made in this judicial process, only acceptance.
God bless you all.
