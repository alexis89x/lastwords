Convicted in the November 1976 shooting death of 43-year-old John Denson, a Montgomery County juvenile probation officer and reserve deputy sheriff, during a burglary at the officer's home in Magnolia. Green and accomplices Joseph Starvaggi and Glenn Earl Martin went to Denson's home to steal his gun collection. Starvaggi shot Denson when the officer struggled with one of the intruders and wrestled his gun away. Starvaggi then shot Denson two more times, but declined Green's alleged urgings to kill the officer's wife and 13-year-old daughter.
