**Summary of Incident**
Convicted in the abduction and slaying of 35-year-old David Dirck VanTassel, Jr., a University of Texas law student. Cook and co-defendant Robert Brian Moore abducted VanTassel from outside the Sheraton Crest Hotel in Austin where he had just completed a State Bar test review. Cook and Moore drove VanTassel in his car to a road side park 14 miles west of Cameron on Hwy. 36 and tied him with his shirt and belt. After taking his watch and wallet, Cook shot VanTassel four times in the head with a .22-caliber pistol. Cook and Moore stole VanTassel's car and later sold it to a man who later identified them in a police lineup. When arrested, Cook was wearing VanTassel's watch and had the victim's wallet in his pocket.
