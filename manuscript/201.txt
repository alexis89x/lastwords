**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the abduction and murder of 38-year-old Cecile Ham, wife of entertainment manager Bill Ham. Goodman approached Ham as she was getting into her car in the parking lot of a Walgreen's store at Dairy Ashford and Memorial in Houston. He knocked her unconscious, pushed her into her red Cadilac, and drove into Fort Bend Co. before stopping and breaking the woman's neck. Police tracked Ham's killer through his use of her credit cards in Central Texas. Goodman, still driving Ham's car, was finally captured following a high-speed chase with police in Eagle County, Colorado on Aug. 7, 1991. He later confessed and directed authorities to where he had dumped Ham's body at a remote site near Pearsall in West Texas.
