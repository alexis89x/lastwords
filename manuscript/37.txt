# July 18 - Derrick, Mikel

**Date of Birth**: February 10  

**Date of Offense**: October 11  

**Date of execution**: July 18  

**Summary of Incident**  
Convicted in the October 1980 robbery-slaying of 32-year-old Edward Sonnier of Houston. Sonnier reportedly took Derrick home with him to his Montrose apartment, where the two smoked marijuana. Derrick told authorities he stabbed Sonnier 15 times when the victim allegedly made an unwelcomed homosexual advance toward him. Derrick stole Sonnier s car, which he later stripped down with the help of friends. Police had no suspects in the killing until Derrick wrote to Harris Co. DA John Holmes saying, "I killed a man to get his car". Derrick wrote from prison, where he was serving time for robbery. He said in the letter that he had heard his brother might be wrongly charge in the theft of Sonnier's car.

**Last statement**  
I just ask everybody I ever hurt or done anything wrong to, to just forgive me for whatever wrongs I done to them.
