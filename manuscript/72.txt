**Summary of Incident**
Killed Tuan Nguyen, 16, a clerk at a Galveston 7-11 store managed by his family. Nguyen was shot once in the heart with a sawed-off .22 caliber rifle fired by Barnard during a robbery. Barnard & three co-defendants fled in a stolen car following the shooting and were arrested about 30 minutes later on 1-45 North of Galveston. The murder weapon was found inside the car, along with a Buck knife and a loaded 12-guage shot gun. Although Nguyen and his father were forced to put the money from the cash register into a bag, Barnard and his co-defendants left the store empty-handed after the shooting.

**Last statement**
